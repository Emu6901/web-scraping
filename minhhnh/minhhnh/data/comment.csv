review_2384696108,Jiwoo Kim,"May 07, 2018","The Devotion of Suspect X is a detective fiction book by Keigo Higashino. I like this book because it is different from the other detective fiction book. The normal detective fiction books are the reader read the story about the person who follows the suspect or the suspect, but this book is the reader read the story about the person close to the suspect. The story is focused on the suspect's side. The three reasons why I can focus on the book more than the other books that I read before are the simile, mood, and foreshadowing that the author used in the book. The first thing that I like about this book is the simile. The author use simile to create mood, which the second thing that I like about in the book. In the book, “The man looked around the shop, both hands thrust into the pockets of his dark navy windbreaker, like a prospective customer trying to figure out what he should buy”. In this sentence, the author use simile to create the mood of the man. Example for the foreshadowing is this, “She had only recently learned that he taught math when she happened to notice outside his apartment door a bundle of old math textbooks, wrapped in string and awaiting disposal”. This means that Ishigami is smart enough to teach math and this will go to affect her. I recommend this book to the young adult age people and adults because this book is complicated for the young age. Or I recommend this book to the people who want to try another style of detective noble.",4,0 likes,1

review_3061940532,Mimi Wolske,"Nov 25, 2019","Letting the reader learn everything about the muder -- the why, who, and how -- in the first couple of chapters isn't new. Yasuko and her daughter, Misato, killed the husband/father. Then, their neighbor, Ishigami, calls and offers to help them bury the body.
How'd he know?
Well, it's Ishigami’s brilliant cover-up that drives the story forward! OMGosh! Brilliant writing!
Anyway, Detective Kusanagi of the Edogawa police and his friend, Yukawa, a friend and a genius who sometimes helps the police, battle to find the truth surrounding Togashi’s murder.
The truth they try to prove is that Yasuko's story is a lie.
We readers see fragments of Ishigami’s plan... At first it seems simplistic; even sort of careless. However, we discover all too soon it's actually quite a deceptive plan and it's pretty complex.
Oh, yeah, Ishigami is a mathematical genius and he's a logical thinker and even tells mother and daughter that logic will get them through everything... yes, he actually applies math ideas to their problem like in that TV series ""Numb3rs"".

review_4338670584,Joanna Chu (The ChuseyReader),"Nov 15, 2021","Thanks Teck for recommending this book! Omg this actually made me cry a few times which is a first!!

~ Quick Summary ~

Three delinquents hide out in an old abandoned general store where they exchange letters with people from the past who are seeking life advice and unexpectedly become life coaches 😆.

~ Pick this up if you enjoy/don’t mind ~

✨ Magic Realism

😢 Emotional and touching stories

🐢 Slower pace

😆 Some comedy

📚 ""the Housekeeper and the Professor” (I definitely enjoyed Namiya more!!)

~ What I loved ~

I loved the use of different POV and timelines because of how they connected. First we were introduced to the delinquents who stumbled upon the magical store and their first letter. I was disappointed when we changed POV but seeing the letter and from a different perspective was actually quite hilarious because it was so brutally honest and I could imagine the delinquents blabbering about what to write.

This was very touching. The people seeking advice were normal, everyday people so they were relatable and it was easy to connect. The lessons that the characters learned were actually so amazing and touching. There were 3 moments that made me unexpectedly emotional. I even cried and that is rare!

~ What I didn’t enjoy ~

The stories were a little boring to begin with, but when the characters learn, develop and think about the advice, it does get interesting and tug at the heartstrings. As there are quite a few stories in there, we have to go back to the beginning to introduce the characters and their stories. So going through that process multiple times does slow down the pace for me.",4,74 likes,2
review_4121332755,chaity,"Jul 23, 2021","what you think this book is:-

what it actually is:-


unapologetically Japanese, beautifully crafted, and heartbreakingly uplifting— the miracles of the namiya general store is a miraculous piece of art and it probably deserves a little more love and appreciation than what its already getting.

people don’t drift apart for one specific reason. well, you might be able to find a reason, but you could come up with one only after you made up your mind, a tired excuse tacked on after the fact.



while i'm mourning all that's been lost in translation, i'm still feeling hopeful and would recommend this book to anyone wanting to hear the stories that this book tells. it, my friend, is a story of some boys next door, of an athlete, of that one golden hearted and talented musician, it's a story of an orphanage, it also happens to be a story of a love, and most of all a story made up with words that were left unsaid, it' s a story of many people that i, unfortunately, will never have the privilege to meet. im never going to meet namiya, i will never get any piece of advice from him, but maybe i can be the namiya is someone else's life, who knows?


anyways, a few realization⤵

➜it's you who changes your life, it's you who has to get up from your bed in the morning, and deal with the world. and you do have control over almost everything in your life.
➜everyone needs advice, but at the end of the day the answer lies in your heart. you already know the solution, you just need someone to show you the path sometimes. and it's okay to seek help.
➜every decision we take, make makes us us
➜we all are, as human beings, somehow connected.





lastly, all my friends loved this book a little bit more than i did. i can tell its mostly me, not the book. i'm not a huge fan of magical realism aspect in contemporary fiction and the time jump is something that easily manages to give me headaches. also the writing put me off. but i dont regret giving it a try. it was worth it.",3,46 likes,2

I wonder how my life would be if I drop a letter to the Namiya General Store. Who’s going to answer my life’s quandary? Mr. Namiya or the three burglars? This novel kind of reminded me of Before The Coffee Gets Cold because of its magical connection with TIME. Completely unrelated in terms of the premise but reading Japanese books is slowly becoming the norm for me. They bring a different colour to my reading experience.

This was truly a heartwarming yet tear-inducing read reminiscent of the quaint magic Studio Ghibli films always have. No one would expect that Keigo Higashino, a resident powerhouse of the Japanese crime fiction genre, would be the genius behind this masterpiece. However, I noticed that all of his books always examine the value of filial love and have a heartfelt theme despite the fact that the story centers on a murder.

The Miracles of the Namiya General Store follows this theme as well and fleshes out the lives of the letter senders in the past and weaves it into an intertwining tapestry of human relationships transcending time. At times, I was frustrated with the three delinquents' brash ignorance and I wished that their personal stories were also examined more. However, they had developed by the end quite well and I was really touched with their reflections brought by the magic pervading in the store.

I really felt elated and full of love while reading this book! It really emphasized how our words influence the course of people's lives without really knowing the magnitude of its effects on them. This is by far one of my favorite pieces from Keigo Higashino, and I'm now sure of the fact that he's my favorite author of the year.

P.S. There's also a movie released in 2017 so I'm off to watch it now and cry all over again HAHAHA.
P.P.S. I just finished watching the movie and I loved it especially when the song Reborn was performed huhuhuh I still love the book more though as it's more nuanced and contemplative.",5,47 likes,2

Soon a leeter was dropped in the store seeking store owner's advice about some dilemma that a young woman was facing at that time in her life. Thieves after a heated discussion decides to help the young woman by answering her questions, thus starting a chain of questions and answers that takes the reader back and forth in time in the life of different people who at some point dropped a letter in the store in search of answers to their questions.

Many characters were introduced throughout the story. Some of their stories left me with teary eyes while others put a smile on my face. Despite many arcs in story everything was tied up neatly in the end making it a very satisfying read for me.

This was my second book by the author and this was a complete opposite of Malice. He dealt with human emotions so differently here than Malice, and I am in awe of him how he tells his stories. And that makes me want to read another of his book sooner.

“People don't drift apart for one specific reason. Well, you might be able to find a reason, but you could come up with one only after you made up your mind, a tired excuse tacked on after the fact. If their hearts were still in it and their bond was threatening to sever, you'd think one of them would step in and try to fix things. When no one does, you you know the bond has already been broken.”


The Plot: Atsuya, Koehi and Shota - three really close friends are currently on a run. They have done something very wrong. They just robbed a woman.Trying to find the perfect to hide, they come across to an old abandoned house. To be more specific a decades old general store- The Namiya General Store. They take shelter there for a night. But they never imagined that this ""one night"" will change their whole lives.

This deeply moving story follows several different characters across decades in time, all of them linked by a magical little place; a general store called ""The Namiya General Store"". A old named Mr. Yuji Namiya is the owner of this store. He’s a man living the last phase of his life. His wife has passed away and he decides on a whim to give written advice to correspondents. So, he starts accepting handwritten letters from anyone who has a question to ask and try his earnest to give them the right replies and advices. That's how this incredible journey of the Namiya General Store begins......

◇ I loved:

*The writing: I really loved the easy and accessible writing of this book. It was very simple yet elegant. I just flew through the writing. The translation was amazing.

*The characters: This book features a huge cast of diverse characters. The author has beautifully portrayed all of these characters. Loved how the story is told from different perspectives across the time. All of the characters belong to different times and places. So, their way of thinking, their conflicts and decisions weren't similar. That's what made everything seem so real. All of the characters are inter-connected and the common connection they have is the Namiya General Store. I liked the characters cast a lot. The only problem I faced with it was that I couldn't remember their names. There are lots of names and I kept forgetting them. This somehow affected my reading experience. As I told you, all the characters are inter-related. So, It's for the best to remember them all. And I couldn't. I just couldn't memorize who is who. By the way, the aspiring musician was my favourite character. Loved Sota too.

*The letters: The letters were life. Okay? I absolutely adored all these different types of letters. The author weaves an intertwining tapestry of human relationships that transcends time. I highly admired the way the author sewed all these broken promises and conflicted hearts together and crafted this masterpiece of a book.

*Others: ""The Miracles of the Namiya General Store"" is a heart breaking tale of humanity, finding ones true self, our conflicts, the decisions we make and how a single piece of word can change our lives. Mr. Namiya started a wonderful job and the three boys finished it.

◇ Cons: The main problem I had with the book is the time jumps. They were bit too much. The jumps between time and places confused me. For a moment, we are here in the 21st century and then, suddenly we are in the 80s. Well, that felt kinda under whelming.

“Be a fighter. Give it everything you’ve got. Even a losing battle is worth fighting. Go out and make your mark.”


Despite having a con or two, this book is a must read for everyone. I devoured it. I really liked it and enjoyed the whole time reading it. Now, I am really really interested in checking out more books by Japanese authors.

P.S. There is also a movie. Check that one out...",4,32 likes,2

I wish there were a Namiya General Store everywhere around the world. If not so, just one person like Yuji Namiya, who'd take even pranks seriously.

This book was heart melting. It felt like a warm hug across time. It made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me nostalgic, it made me believe in miracles.

If this book had nothing but those letters, sent through the mail slot and answered in the milk crate, it'd still be a wonderful book. But the author gave every letter a story and some wonderful characters. And of course - the miracles, the time travelling of not just the letters, but also lives and emotions.

In the five chapters, we found seven different stories. Five of them were of the seekers of advices, one was of Yuji Namiya himself and another was of the brutal advice givers! Five who sought advices, took them differently. One could only see what she wanted to see. One stuck to the advice untill the very end. One realised the inner meaning and took her decision accordingly. One didn’t take the advice and the other found some ""premonitions"" unasked.

But the most amazing thing is, all of the stories were interconnected through time and space. The author left no loose threads. He woved them all together and created this outstanding piece of literature.",5,17 likes,2

review_3880684026,K.J. Charles,"Mar 09, 2021","A very soft and cuddly book. Premise: a general store manager randomly becomes an agony uncle of sorts, answering anonymous questions and doing his best to help. 33 years after his death, three young hoodlums hole up in the abandoned store, and find letters from the past coming through the letterbox. So they start answering them, rather less tactfully.

The stories are nicely interwoven, the time jump aspect nicely worked out, and the way the advice works is fun, as we see people interpreting and reacting to the advice in ways shaped far more by themselves than by the advice givers. Yes, whimsical, bit sentimental, and the translation is rather clunky, but whatever: it's a feel-good book (though with quite a lot of hard things noted about Japan and capitalism and sexism) and the ending is super uplifting and really nicely led up to. However, if I gave stars I would have to dock one for the realisation that the 1980s are now basically a period of historical rather than contemporary fiction. Goddammit.",0,31 likes,2
review_2169610666,Narin Kim,"Oct 31, 2017","This magical story about a magical Store offers readers strange comfort. It is about 3 thieves looking for a place to hide on their way to escape from the police. They reach an old house that looks like an old General store and decides to make their way in, spend the night there, and make their way out in the morning. However, as they look around the house, they realize that there's something going on in this house. Something strange. They receive an envelope in the mailbox outside the store and gets shocked about it since the store seemed like it was closed decades ago, and the text in the mail seemed like it was from the past. The mail was about troubles this woman had and was asking them to help. They decide to reply back, and they soon realize that this store manager from a long time ago helped solve his villager's troubles. As the story goes on, they receive more envelopes and it shows different kinds of trouble different people have and how the 3 thieves reply back. This story is very interesting because it goes through the past and present times and how the thieves give feedback to those mails are quite funny, too. But at last, it shows heartwarming stories/troubles and big lessons of how they solved those troubles.

This is my lifelong book; also for many Koreans since it's a very well-known book in Korea. If there is an English version of this book, I would definitely recommend it to more elderly people since there are few parts where it may get a little confusing (time lapse between the past and present), and I think it has stories that more elderly people can relate to. It is such a great book and such an interesting book I can't even explain how good it was to me. I definitely would give this book 6 stars, If I could.",5,22 likes,2

I was really engaged from the start to the end, and reading the Vietnamese version makes me able to relate and sympathize more with the characters. Usually I don’t like the “time-traveling” type of book because stuff like that often has too many logical holes in it. But this story has just the right amount of unrealistic components that I could be totally comfortable with. I got it from the first set of letters that this will be somehow interwoven so it was not surprising. However, Keigo’s masterful way of story-telling and character-building still makes this book very interesting and engaging. We know the characters deeply enough to feel invested in their stories, but not too much so that we can still observe their fates unfold as an outsider. A solid 4*",4,14 likes,2

review_2972538709,Christine Sandquist,"Sep 19, 2019","The Miracles of Namiya General Store is a book of interconnected short stories focusing on the lives of individuals who were helped or shaped by both the store and a nearby orphanage, called Marumitsuen. It follows a group of delinquents, an Olympic fencer, and a real estate tycoon amongst others. It’s a book about how everyone’s lives are connected to one another, how one small action can lead to much larger impacts spanning across generations.

This book comes full circle, showing how the past has impacted the future. The book opens on three young men, orphans who grew up in Marumitsuen, as they escape from a house they robbed. They’re in their getaway car, discussing plans for the night… their car breaks down. They hoof it over to an abandoned house nearby, where they intend to lay low for the night. Gradually, they begin to notice that things aren’t adding up… the clock on their phones is working strangely, and there’s an odd aura pervading the space. When a letter drops in through the mail slot requesting advice, they know something is up. Their first instinct is to leave, but ultimately… they don’t want to leave the author of the letter unanswered. She is a fencer training for the Olympics, and her boyfriend is struggling with cancer. Although he encourages her to live out their dream for her and keep training as hard as she can, she’s torn between acceding to his wishes and spending her time supporting him through chemotherapy.

As they correspond with her, they come to an abrupt realization: “Moon Rabbit,” as she signs her letters, is not from the present. The letters are coming across years to reach them. She’s confused when they mention the Internet or cell phones, and they ultimately nail down the “when” of her time by asking about favorite songs and films. Moon Rabbit is writing to them from 1979…. the year prior to Japan boycotting the Olympics. Armed with this knowledge, the boys give her advice and do their best to dissuade her from pursing her training and encourage her to stay with her partner. This doesn’t quite work as they intended, but it does ultimately work out for the best.

“He’s an amazing guy. No tricks, no bullshit. I mean, when I told him about my problem, he practically bopped me on the head. But he forced me to figure things out and see that I was getting in my own way. He’s the reason why I was finally able to stop worrying and throw myself into the training.”

After they finish their correspondence with Moon Rabbit, another letter drops in. As the novel progresses, it focuses on multiple other points of view so that we seen not only the letters from each of these individuals, but also how they implemented the advice they were given and about their lives back in time.

While I feel that the core conceit of this book was solid, I felt that overall the plot alone wasn’t enough to justify the slice-of-life nature of this story. Slice of life is very difficult to write well, given that the other elements of the book need to be strong enough to overcome the lack of plot. Characters, atmosphere, and prose are key to a successful novel… and unfortunately, I found that they did not come through with enough strength for me to be fully drawn in to this book. Given the glowing reviews of this book as it is written in other languages, I suspect part of this may be due to a slightly lackluster translation – in the original Japanese, it’s very possible that the prose is utterly to die for. The English version, unfortunately, leaves a bit to be desired and comes off as dry and slightly simplistic.

All in all, this is a good book to read if you want something that’s optimistic as well as a quick and easy read. It’s friendly, cozy, and extremely accessible. This is probably a better fit for people who tend to read fiction as opposed to fantasy or science fiction, as these elements are somewhat lighter than I might have hoped. The story overall is very grounded in reality and feels more like a parable of sorts rather than the exploration of new ideas I tend to expect from speculative fiction.

3,5 of 5 stars!

I love how every chapter is connected with each other's stories! I love how the stories between the athletes and also the shop owner itself. It is my first time to read Keigo Higashino sensei wrote about fantasy surrealism since his specialty is Japan Mystery-thriller. this genre is not bad but i think i still love more his mystery-thriller masterpieces :)

*For Kim Seokjin of BTS who read this books*
At first i'm curious why Jin loves this book? Is it related to their Bangtan Universe world? When i finished read this books okay somehow it is related with Love yourself Highlight reel and Save me webtoon when the parallel world is exist and Jin as the main character wanna save all the members so he repeat time all over and over again so he can chose the perfect scheme for all of them. Time and parallel world is one of the main highlight of this books

Never thought I would be this satisfied after reading a book, this probably one of my best reads this year. I have read 7 books by Keigo Higashino of which on crime thriller and investigation, but The Miracles of the Namiya General Store was totally out of that kind of genre, okay maybe it has a bit of crime in it but this book touches more on humanity and spirits, one's dream that crawls into a parallel universe and intertwined the past and future.

I love how each stories connected and creating a new narrative, on how Yuji Namiya started the miracles-- ""I treat every letter that comes in as a cry for help. These people are no different from the rest of us. They have a hole in their hearts, and something vital is bleeding out. You can't ignore someone who speaks to you from the heart."" The characters were superb-- the three dudes, the musician, the dubious doggy, Paul Lennon also Ms. Moon Rabbit-- they were all my favorite! The story-telling was magnificently inspiring, development and plot transition from each stories were well written, I really enjoyed every bits of it. Love that pinch of The Beatles and few insight of Japan's history.

It was sweet and fantastical, not the usual Keigo Higashino but better. Namiya General Store should continue its service!

***** A real 5 star book.
Namiya and nayami, the Japanese word for problems, woes, whatever. If you come by the Namiya General Store in XX city after hours and slip a letter through the mail slot in their shutter, an answer will be waiting for you in the milk crate around back in the morning. By keeping this in front, the Namiya General Store's Mr. Namiya used to answer little childrens letter and gave advices. Advice 'bout life, 'bout studies and everything..... Like that- a que. ""Tell me how I can get an A+ on a test without studying or cheating or anything."" And it's ans. from Mr. Namiya- ""Ask your teacher to test you on yourself. Since you're the topic of the test, whatever you say will be correct."" this really shows, what a person Namiya was!
The book is so much well writtened (and the translation was also WOW!) that many times I felt the deepest infatuation of my heart for the persons of this book. There was different stories in 1st 4 chapters and in the 5th, they all came in the same place . The last (last~est~) reply of the blank letter was really a miracle! The book was like TIME TRAVELLING !

review_3435599857,Lauren,"Oct 14, 2021","This book is beautifully written and effortlessly intertwines the various characters’ lives we encounter throughout. There is a completeness to this book which you don’t find in most other novels and this is why it is such a satisfying read.

I will say I didn’t love all of the 5 chapters equally and felt that chapter 4 was the weakest. Conversely chapter 2 was the one which affected me the most emotionally and chapter 3 also really stood out to me as a very strong story. There is an affecting poignancy to all of the chapters and characters’ lives and the advice the owner (and later the 3 delinquents give) to ordinary citizens is life-affirming and fundamentally human.

I was touched throughout whilst reading this magical and thought-provoking book and some of the chapters will stay with me for a while to come (including that ending)! *shivers*",4,9 likes,2

It was awesome to see how the different stories are all intertwined. The concept was very good and unique as well. It was a jump between past and present all in a single night and it was very interesting.

What fell short was for me the structure of the book. It is divided in different parts but every single one follows the exact same format, repeating the same dynamics over and over again, so unfortunately in the end I got bored.

The characters were okay but they could have been worked out better, they were all a little flat.

So overall it was interesting to see how the story developed and ended but it reaped the same building over and over.",3,8 likes,2

This book cleverly weaves together the story of all its characters into a complex tapestry of relationships forged throughout time. I loved the detail and nuance in each letter-writer's personal story and background, but wished the three men giving advice were also developed a bit more.

At first, I was annoyed by how harsh and ignorant the men's, and especially Atsuya's, advice was, but I loved their development through the novel as they grew and learned from each correspondent.

review_3076775759,Ian Josh,"Jan 14, 2020","I enjoy Higashino very much, and his last work translated into English (The Newcomer) was of a sweeter variety than his mysteries, but I liked it... but sometimes there’s just too much.

I enjoyed the setup in this novel. The hints and beginning of something magical. It helped I started just before Christmas and I couldn’t help but see some comparisons to One Magic Christmas, a film that is arguably too sappy, but also sometimes feels just perfect.

Maybe I should have finished this book by Christmas Eve, before the Magic drifted away? Maybe?

But even taking a chance to relax this holiday season before picking this up to finish in the early days of January can’t be used as an excuse for what is either weak plotting, or possibly mid-decisions by the translator or his editors.

If the Japanese was this sappy, the English should have had just a little pulled away. Besides that, if Higashino over explained every little nugget, than a strong English editor should have been brave enough to say that this wasn’t necessary in English.

It’s fun when something from page 10 connects to something on page 150, but much less so when it’s pointed out, or screamed out, as it is here.

“Hey look, look what I did. Isn’t it smart and cute and sweet? See, this character is connected to that one, and these two are the same person... see, look, don’t miss it.”

A little subtlety would have improved this book a lot, and a bit more editing could have grown what began as promising and interesting into a more enjoyable book.

As it is, this is easily the worst of the Higashino books available in English and I can’t recommend it his fans or fans of sweet magical tales.

A shame, as it feels like it could have been much better, especially with Higashino as the writer.",2,7 likes,2
review_3126557730,Reading_ Tamishly,"Jan 07, 2020","Nope. No, this isn't your typical detective-murder-hunt-the-rat book. This is almost a psychological thriller where the answer has been thrown to the reader from the very first page yet it gives the thrill with amazing twists and turns as to why the character did what he did.
The title has been so aptly given. It explains everything! Damn this book is so good. The mathematician genius clashing with his old school mate, another Physics genius. Everything is out there. Nothing much to solve to find who who did the obvious or the reasons behind it. It's the intense character study and presentation that made the book so damn amazing. Yes, shortcomings are there when things tend to fly above your head when these two seemingly geniuses talk about the same things. I don't think it was even necessary. But still....wow...I was wowed...and wowed still.

For a book like this, if I try to write something about the story or the plot it will just ruin everything. So I won't. But I guarantee you it's a very different read with indepth character study and reasons why and what of the event that happened. Ah, the devotion. Seriously, it's all about this devotion.

review_2322855571,carol.,"Apr 08, 2018","Both unusual and familiar, The Devotion of Suspect X is an unassuming mystery with an astonishing approach.

It is a book that will toy with the very definition of the concept of 'spoilers:' it begins with a few hours in our main characters' daily routines, then quickly jumps into an emotional scene that results in murder. I admit that I was doubtful; how was I to stay interested in a mystery where I already knew the answers to the 'who-what-where-why-when?' But Hiashino is quite masterful, drawing a veil over the disposition of the body. The reader is left in a unique position of knowing more than the police about where the investigation should end, but discovering clues with the police as they work backwards.

The narrative follows both the police investigation and the viewpoint of the perpetrator(s), leaving me marveling at the chess game. Something in it puts me in mind of Agatha Christie, although it could be that she's just the one I always think of when it comes to non-gory murder and a more nuanced form of suspense. It is a book that is as much about characters and social protocols as much as mystery, but don't let that frighten you away. There's a distinct whiff of literary-fiction about this as well, a story that is also about the everyday lives and the future dreams of the characters.

My complaints are very small; there was a preponderance of characters whose names began with 'K,' and I believe at least two had first and last names with 'K.' A switch from first to last name use depending on who was talking proved initially confusing and left me glad I could flip back a few pages. The ending... sigh. Appropriate, but leaving me ambivalent. The air of melancholy is too strong for me to want to add this to my library, thus the less than 5 stars.

The fact that this was a best-seller in Japan left me bemused. According to the author's GR page, ""The Devotion of Suspect X was the second highest selling book in all of Japan— fiction or nonfiction—the year it was published, with over 800,000 copies sold."" I find this especially interesting when I think of the mysteries thrillers that routinely top American best-seller lists. This is almost the exact opposite kind of story, and for me, a far more fulfilling one. It leaves me curious to check out Higashino's other works.

Firstly this is originally a Japanese novel and has been translated into English. The translation is done pretty well and the flow of the story is really good.

Basic Plot: A crime is committed and then a plan is formed to cover-up the crime.
""What they needed was a perfect defense based on perfect logic.""

What happens when the investigation is being done by a genius and the cover-up by a mastermind.



This book was like an intense chess match and after each move from one end there was another counter-move from the other end.

The twists in the last few chapters had my mind reeling. I think part of the main twist in the book is somewhat similar to a twist in one of Agatha Christie's novel (view spoiler)

review_1460416443,Nandakishore Mridula,"Dec 04, 2015","The classic whodunit works by misdirection, same as a magic trick. As is the case with the magician, so with the mystery writer - the more the skill in the smoothness of execution, the more mystifying the trick seems. But unlike the magician (who never tells), the author tells everything in the end: as the clever detective reveals how the public have been duped by the villain, the reader is also equally dumbfounded. The success of the mystery is in direct proportion to the amount of mystification.

In this novel, Keigo Higashimo presents a clever variation. The murder happens during the first and second chapters, and we immediately know who committed it! Yasuko, a single mother living alone with her daughter is forced to kill her ex-husband in self-defence. When she plans to turn herself in, her neighbour Ishigami, a reclusive mathematical genius who is obsessed with her, prevents it. He concocts a seemingly unbreakable alibi for mother and daughter: however, unfortunately for Ishigami, the physicist and amateur sleuth Manabu Yukawa, his former classmate and genius of equal standing is on the case. What follows is a absorbing cat-and-mouse game between the two, with really devastating denouement.

The core of the mystery is not new - I can remember the same plot device used in at least three more stories by other authors (no, I won't reveal which stories they are!). I should have seen the ending coming, but I was taken in by a simple ploy by the author. There is a big plot hole - the police immediately zeroing in on Yasuko and her daughter is unbelievable - but we can condone that in such a tightly written story.

What fascinated me, and raised this book to four stars, was the tussle between the mathematician - who delights in creating insoluble puzzles - and the physicist interested in tweaking out nature's laws from her behaviour, and building mathematical models for the same. The P=NP problem - whether it is easier to work out a solution to problem by oneself, or to check whether another's solution for the same is correct or not - seems to me fascinating.

----------------------------------------

PS: I read this book because of the Malayalam blockbuster movie Drishyam (""Visual""), rumoured to be plagiarised from it. While the movie is in all probability inspired by this story, it is not a copy, and a refreshingly new take on the ""unbreakable alibi"".",4,129 likes,3
review_120488544,Irene,"Sep 07, 2010","Not only is THE DEVOTION OF SUSPECT X a multi-faceted cultural reading experience, but it also acutely complements the familiar psychological suspense/thriller/mystery genre by infusing Japanese philosophy. Keigo Higashino shrewdly and subtly induces the reader to contemplate the immeasurable complexities of the human psyche by questioning what motivates one human being to judge who is worthy of life, and who is not.

Tetsuya Ishigami’s daily schedule is precisely what one would expect of a Japanese mathematics’ teacher. His unsuccessful attempts to motivate visibly bored and apathetic students discourage Ishigami, and his one true passion of solving a complex mathematical formula, lies outside of the classroom within the confines of his small apartment. A barren life carved out of necessity dramatically changes when Yasuko and her daughter Misato introduce themselves as his new neighbors. He imagines a fantasy life with them, listening to mother and daughter through the thin apartment walls, and his daily walk to school includes a stop to purchase his boxed lunch at the small shop where Yasuko works. Within this fictitious context, Ishigami surprisingly exhibits a fierce desire to protect both mother and daughter, and so begins a bizarre tale that originates with the unexpected arrival of Yasuko’s nefarious ex-husband Togashi.

To divulge the minute intricacies of this suspenseful tale would require *spoilers.* Ishigami’s masterful, methodical, and devious scheme demands a skillful exposé by the incongruous, yet highly likeable duo of Dr.Yukama and Detective Kusanagi, the intrepid investigators who are destined to unravel the shocking and mind-boggling conundrum. Imperial University graduates in different fields, Ishigami, Yukama and Kusanagi, seem equally matched; Ishigami, unappreciated mathematical master of a methodical crime committed to protect Yasuko and Misato, and Yukama, preeminent master of rare intuitive observations of human frailties, and Kusanagi, resolute advocate of justice match their unparalleled wits to a stunning unbelievable conclusion. The factual drama predominantly hinges on the intellectual “cat and mouse” chase between Ishigami, “Buddha” at University and Yukama, affectionately known as “Professor Galileo” by the police.

Initially, the translation was a bit stilted, but once engrossed in the book, it was hardly noticeable. In addition to the utterly fascinating and distinctive premise, the cultural milieu depicted an informative contemporary view of Japanese life.",5,65 likes,3

review_1114626651,Carol,"Nov 24, 2014","The Devotion of Suspect X is a must-read for anyone who appreciates police procedurals, mysteries, math, Japan, literature . . . I could go on. The Devotion of Suspect X is the third in the Detective Galileo series, but I didn't once have the impression that I lacked background or relationship information gleaned from the initial 2 books. In fact, there were no references to prior cases or mysteries to suggest that earlier books existed. If not for the publishers blurbs on the book, I'd not have guessed they did.

So why is The Devotion of Suspect X an excellent read?
1. The lead detective, Kusanagi, is a normal, standard, by-the-book, thoughtful, straight arrow. What distinguishes this novel from other police procedurals is Kusanagi's friend, Yukawa, a physicist. Yukawa solves the mystery and cares deeply about the outcome. Because ....
2. Ishigami, a high school math teacher whose brilliance and devotion to math are here allocated to assisting his ordinary, likable next door neighbor in covering up a murder, by employing masterful misdirection to focus the police on time-wasting, unimportant questions and issues. His efforts to motivate apathetic high school students won my respect and, at the same time, my pity. Otherwise, he's not an easy character to get to know or to feel anything about, except that Yukawa's concern for him makes the reader care. Nonetheless you respect his genius.
3. The ending is one of the best I've ever read. The mystery is solved 20 pages before. It doesn't matter. There's many a thriller or mystery novelist who get an A+ for plot, but don't have a clue how to write a compelling ending. I read the last several paragraphs a few times over - they were just that good.
4. Japan. The style of this novel is insanely plot-driven and at the same time calm, quiet, methodical, and thoughtful. No screeching tires. No bickering between the detectives. No threatening with guns. In an alternative universe where Lee Child is raised and lives in Japan, this might be the series he'd have written instead of the Jack Reacher books (which I also love, for different reasons, and which are culturally and quintessentially American).

The family was happy and lived well until Shinji's employers discovered he was a thief and fired him. After that Yasuko took a job as a bar hostess....



.....and larcenous Shinji sat home, ate and drank, and took all his wife's earnings.



If Yasuko protested, Shinji beat her, and he also frightened his young step-daughter.



Eventually Yasuko managed to divorce Shinji, but he continued to harass her and ask for money. To get away from her ex-husband, Yasuko moved and took a job in a boxed lunch shop, hoping to ditch creepy Shinji for good.



However Shinji tracked his former wife down at the shop, made noises about getting back together, and made implicit threats about Misato - now a pretty teenager.



Yasuko is trying decide what to do about Shinji when he unexpectedly shows up at her apartment. Yasuko is upset, Misato is freaked out, and Shinji ends up dead on the floor.



As it happens Yasuko's next door neighbor Tetsuya Ishigami - a brilliant math teacher - has a crush on Yasuko. He's too shy to speak to her, but stops at the boxed lunch shop most days, to see her and order a meal.



Ishigami is home during the altercation between Shinji and Yasuko and her daughter, and he hears the hubbub leading to Shinji's death. Since Ishigami is secretly in love with Yasuko, he offers to help the ladies. They agree, and Ishigami does what he does.

When the homicide victim is found near a river, Detective Shunpei Kusanagi gets the case.



As usual Kusanagi consults his physicist friend Manabu Yukawa (aka Detective Galileo), a brainy fellow who's helped solve crimes in the past.



It so happens that physicist Yukawa and math professor Ishigami were at university together decades ago, and the physicist comes to suspect the mathematician had some hand in the crime. This leads to a 'battle of the brains', with Yukawa trying to discover what REALLY happened to victim Shenji, and Ishigami trying to preserve the cover up.

review_325976623,Dyuti,"May 08, 2012","The Devotion of Suspect X is the third book of the 'Detective Galileo' series by the author Keigo Higashino. The reason why I believe it has managed to attain such popularity, is because the book has broken free from the shackles of the typical 'whodunnit' format. The author presents us with a greater challenge than wondering who the murderer is: he keeps us guessing about how the murder can be hidden, in order to make it a perfect crime.

The premise of the story, as oft-repeated, is simple.

Yasuko is a single mother to her teen-aged daughter Misato. She is frequently troubled by her ex-husband who reappears intermittently to extort money from her. One day, things go a little out of hand, and Yasuko, in a terrible fit of rage, ends up killing him. Her neighbor Ishigami, a high school maths teacher, comes to her rescue. He gives her the perfect alibi, with the perfect plan to cover up the murder.

Investigating the murder is Detective Kusanagi, who finds himself drawn into one of his most puzzling cases. He can sense something is wrong, but can’t put his finger to it. Thus, he takes the help of his friend, Yukawa, a physist with a penchant to solve crimes, thus earning himself the title ‘Detective Galileo’.

What follows next is the ensuing battle of wits between the two geniuses: Ishigami and Yukawa. As the story progresses, we are forced to wonder, in the author's own words,""Which is harder: devising an unsolvable problem, or solving that problem"". I believe these two characters are the best sketched out, and they interested me the most.

However, one down-side to the novel was the abysmally bad translation. The sentences were jerky, and the flavour of the book was destroyed by the limp sentences. So, it took me a while to ignore that and get drawn into the story. Also, towards the middle, it kind of did get a bit slow, and I wished there were some more twists or actions.

On the whole it was quite an enjoyable read, but a few things were off the key which stopped me from loving it.However, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it to all those who would like to savour something out of the ordinary, on a wintery or rainy night.

review_603617263,Abhinav,"Apr 30, 2013","Whoa! I finished reading the final 220 odd pages in less than 3 hours. That must be some kind of a personal best for me.

All of the crime thrillers I had read before this had the same template of the classical whodunit, with a few alterations here & there. But it was always on me to try & guess the identity of the culprit until the end when the book finally provides the revelation.

But what if you're already told 'who done it' in the first couple of chapters itself? Believe me, I thought that was the end of the book. I mean, how can a crime thriller be kept interesting when you already know who the killer is? After all, we're not expecting something like 'Crime and Punishment'.

And that is perhaps the biggest achievement of Keigo Higashino's 'The Devotion of Suspect X', the first in the Detective Galileo series. This novel achieved cult status in Japan & sold more than 2 million copies while also being made into a successful screen adaptation. When I was done reading this, I could see why.

The story starts off in a quiet neighbourhood of Tokyo where a single woman Yasuko & her daughter Misato are living peacefully. Their neighbour Ishigami is a talented mathematician who now works as a school teacher. When Yasuko's ex-husband turns up on her doorstep on a fateful night, a moment of indiscretion from both mother & daughter results in wheels being set in motion. Ishigami somehow gets involved in all this & the situation develops into something from which no one can turn back to living their normal lives. Think I somewhat spoiled it for you already? Be rest assured, I haven't revealed what forms the essence of the plot. What follows is a fascinating cat-and-mouse game between Ishigami & Manabu Yukawa, an assistant physics professor & an amateur sleuth also known as 'Detective Galileo'.

This book is not as much about the consequences of the crime as it is about how the crime was done & the possible reasons of committing the crime from the investigating officer's point of view. You know already who is guilty, but there are still so many aspects that remain unclear, which draws the reader into the tale. There are also a few sub-plots - one of them being an old connection between Ishigami & Yukawa, which makes their conversations delightful to read as they talk science & mathematical logic.

But the narrative perhaps emerges as the biggest winner in this novel. The unique approach could have gone all wrong if the narrative would not have been tightly-written & perfectly paced. Full marks to the author as well as the translator Alexander O. Smith who retain the interest of the reader till the end & render us an absolute page-turner. I also liked how themes like infatuation, platonic love & devotion (yeah, it's in the title itself) were explored throughout the course of the story.

I'm going with 4 stars for 'The Devotion of Suspect X' by Keigo Higashino. This is my first brush with Japanese literature, and my appetite craves for more. Highly recommended for fans of international crime fiction.",4,29 likes,3

Boring Person:

A totally different spin on the much-covered grounds of murder mystery, this novel is sure to bring chills to fans of the genre and casual readers alike. I’m not going to ruin the fun by spoiling anything but I’m just going say that it’s been quite a while since I really enjoyed one from this genre. The crime is committed in the first two chapters without hiding the identity of the culprits and you might be left wondering what more is there for you to read. Don’t make the mistake of assuming that. Keigo Higashino carefully concocts a layered façade to a crime that trumps other so-called crimes of passion. On top of that an intellectual battle, like a chess match, goes on in the background. You just can’t stop reading. For me, the strongest suit of this novel is the characters; they really take hold of you and you can’t help but empathize. Not since Crime and Punishment have I rooted for the culprit, or culprits in this case, to walk free. The tension mounts steadily and never slackens. Then the reveal takes you unexpectedly and I didn’t even get close to guessing it. Like a magician, Higashino carefully employs misdirection to suit his sleight-of-hand. Up till the bitter-end it’ll take your breath away. My only problem with this is the translation by Alexander O. Smith. It feels a bit too rough, and sometimes the flow of the book feels stilted. Not that it’s unreadable, but in better hands this experience would’ve been so much better. All in all, a great crime-thriller novel that’s both terribly smart and affecting.

By the way, this is an absolute ""must read"" top rated story which will thrill you right from the word go.

As you begin turning the pages, you would become acquainted with Yasuko Hanoaka, a single parent who has needed to move to get away from her ex, at long last snaps when he appears at her new entryway. When she and her little girl coincidentally murder him, Yasuko plans to hand herself over as the sole culprit to save her little girl. Enter gave neighbor Ishigami, a secondary school math educator equipped for making the ideal explanation: too secure to be in any way broken, deliberately intended to appear to be conceivable as opposed to devised.

Ishigami puts his life hanging in the balance for Yasuko in light of the fact that he cherishes her. Until the definitely twisty arrangement of inversions toward the end, creator Keigo Higashino produces pressure stuffed with a great deal of tension.

review_2526836737,Apoorva,"Sep 18, 2018","** spoiler alert ** The Devotion of Suspect X begins with Yasuko, a divorced mother who lives with her daughter Misato. Her abusive ex husband who's been exhorting money from her decides to show up at her place. Things go out of hand and Yasuko ends up killing him with the help of Misato. Her next door neighbor Ishigami, a high school math teacher, aware of the incident takes control of the situation and helps her get rid of the body and cover up the murder and provides instructions to them about what part to play.

This book is simply amazing. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time wondering how it'll all turn out. It was such a delight to see two geniuses battling it out. We have Ishigami, a teacher obsessed with Maths who likes solving difficult problems and Yukawa, a physicist and his former colleague who's master of observation and assists police frequently in their investigations and is known as detective Galileo. We are presented with a mathematical conundrum: P = NP -whether it’s more difficult to think of the solution to a problem yourself or to ascertain if someone else’s answer to the same problem is correct. Ishimagi weaves an elaborate story of murder around him and presents the answer while it rests on Yukawa to figure it out.

The brilliance of the book lies in it's simplicity. Ishigami likes designing problems in a way that takes advantage of the blind spot created by the person's assumption which tricks him. From the start we are presented with some information and we try to figure it out considering one possibility but in the end we find out that we fell into the trap. That's what Ishigami does and that's what the book does to you. I got the L and Kira vibes from it simply because of the way both were trying to outmaneuver each other. I felt really bad for Ishigami at the end cuz his plan fell apart in spite of him doing everything in his power to make it successful. I sympathized with him when I learnt the reason for his devotion. But all actions have consequences and this is no different. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the book immensely.

'When an amateur attempts to conceal something, the more complex he makes his camouflage, the deeper the grave he digs for himself. But not so a genius. The genius does something far simpler, yet something no normal person would even dream of, the last thing a normal person would think of doing. And from this simplicity, immense complexity is created.’ Pretty much sums it up.

If you're a fan of thriller, you should definitely read this book.",5,25 likes,3

review_3024532316,Shruti,"Oct 28, 2019","The Devotion of Suspect X is one of the most mind boggling books that I have ever read. Keigo Higashino has managed to successfully narrate the complex and perplexing story of a murder and the subsequent, brilliant coverup.

This book relies heavily on logic and flaws of the human thought process—taking advantage of the so-called blind spots that arise due to the assumptions we subconsciously make. Unlike many other books of the kind, the police are portrayed as incredibly competent, making the story all the more riveting. I found myself switching between rooting for the police and rooting for the suspects; a fight between worthy contenders.

An unusual and engrossing story, the end left me slightly distressed which worked perfectly with the rest of the narrative. The Devotion of Suspect X is impressive to say the least. I really look forward to reading Higashino's other works.",4,23 likes,3

review_232350387,Tony,"Nov 07, 2011","I've read perhaps ten or so Japanese crime novels seen maybe fifteen Japanese crime films, have read some non-fiction about the Japanese underworld, and have been to the country. All of which is to say that while I'm not fluent in the culture, I didn't come to this story completely unversed in it either. Unfortunately, this particular book seems to be a case of a publisher trying to find the next big international crime thriller hit, and releasing a book with some major flaws.

The story revolves around a divorced single mother who works the counter at a small takeout place. When her nasty ex-husband tracks her down and tries to milk her for money, things get violent and she and her daughter end up killing him in the fight. Facing the prospect of jail and foster care, they accept the offer of their quiet neighbor Mr. Ishigami to make their problem disappear. The unremarkable middle-aged neighbor is a high-school math teacher with no friends or family, but a genius-level brain. He's been nursing a crush on his neighbor and is ready and willing to cover up for her. (All of this is on the book jacket, so I'm not spoiling anything.) The bulk of the book involves the police investigation that follows, and whether or not Ishigami is going to be able to maintain the deception. Now, to the flaws:

First, the entire book is predicated on the police honing in on the ex-wife as the only suspect. This despite their being divorced for a number of years, and him being an unemployed, nasty character of no fixed address or means, who had embezzled money from a previous employer. The obvious notion that he could have had any number of enemies, especially underworld ones, is never examined the police. Why? Because it would have completely torpedoed the premise of the book, so instead it's just...ignored.

OK, I'm willing to overlook one large hole if a book makes it worth my while Unfortunately, a massive coincidence is unleashed which is also central to the story. The police detective assigned to the case happens to regularly consult with a brilliant physicist (named Yukawa, presumably in tribute to the Nobel laureate), in the manner of Inspector Lestrade consulted with Sherlock Holmes. And it just so happens that not only did Yukawa go to university with Ishigami, they were friends! This makes him literally the only person in the entire world both smart enough and familiar enough with Ishigami's manner of thinking to potentially unravel his plan. I mean, I'm all for suspension of disbelief in my entertainment, but that's just silly.

And yet I kept reading, just to see how the story would conclude. It's not a bad puzzle, although the big twist toward the end didn't exactly shock me. There had been plenty of deliberate mentions of a particular group of people in the book, so I knew one of them would be playing an important role at some point. There's one final twist at the end that is a purely tonal one, shifting it from what could be considered a happy ending to a tragic one. It's not a choice I would have made, but it's in keeping with a lot of Japanese crime stories, so I guess it works in that context. All in all, I'm kind of baffled that a book with such serious flaws could have been such a hit, spawning a TV crime series featuring Yukawa and a film adaptation of the book (Suspect X).",1,20 likes,3

My second book that I've read by Higashino and I love his writing. This one was even better than THE NAME OF THE GAME IS A KIDNAPPING, and I can see how readers who enjoyed THE DEVOTION OF SUSPECT X first might have been disappointed. This was masterfully done. Again, there's an adroit use of misdirection and again, I saw so many pieces, but one--a delightful twist.

This appealed to me, and while the mystery itself, the game is great, I enjoyed the interactions between Ishigami and Yukawa best. In fact, the rest of the story became rather irrelevant as I just fell into the story of friendship and competition.

And the math. I suppose I understood Ishigami very well, that compulsion and drive that can tune out reality so that all that is left is the puzzle--it's a very addicting thing where reality is a distraction from the hunt. And while some may find this tragic, I don't. At first perhaps, but when it all settles I think Ishigami has found his answer.

“Which is harder: devising an unsolvable problem, or solving that problem?”

On a recent re-watch on the Malayalam movie Drishya, I thought it would be good if the movie, or even the re-tellings (I am here regarding only the Indian versions, the Japanese ones did have that much sense) from it would have done to pay homage to the book behind their motivation. I was sceptical enough before picking this one up, but got interested when I saw my friend invest all his pocket-money to buy all the books by Higashino at once. It was back in 2017, I had already given up on this genre, but can’t still help gulping down the three books in a row!

It’s not actually a whodunnit, rather better be described as howdunnit. For the suspence of the tale lies in the play-works of the academic-turned-criminal, of whom you will know from the very first. The tale is about how he did what he did, compared to what the administration thought was done.

The story actually revolves around a struggling single mother, and her daughter; how they accidentally commit a crime, and how their well-wishing neighbour comes up with a plan to save them from administrative harassment. Not just a plan, a master plan. Anything more will spoil the story, (though I’m very sure most have read it already). About the cat-and-mouse part, the book is ridiculously great, and even if you may have an inkling to what is going to happen in the end, courtesy to the numerous movie adaptations worldwide, you can’t simply foresee the exact ending to the part. Please don’t start overthinking from the very start, now!

“The sun had set. Night had come to the city. How easy it would be if everything went dark, and the world ended right here, right now. What a relief it would be.”

Also notable in the book is the conversations between Ishigami and Yukawa. Scintillating, actually, from the times of their youth. A conflict between two genius minds, are always a pleasure to read, regardless of the subject concerned. Yukawa isn’t a matter of highlight in here, and the character-sketch of Ishigami is “Ruddy brilliant”, to say the least.

Unlike most works of this very sub-type, this book focusses more on the antagonist. And the emotional turmoil a man can get through, on not receiving the appropriate recognition. Without spoiling anything, it can be told that it doesn’t have an open-ending, on the other hand, a particularly sad ending. What did touch me more about the book was the high dose of emotional quotient, that somehow didn’t feel unnatural at all. And truth be said, it’s more of a love story than just a fast-paced crime novel. And that’s what makes the book stand out.

It’s not a tale of vengeance. Usually, in tales of gruesome vengeance, we end up feeling “Yes, Justice has been served” even if the crime wasn’t punished; but if you look carefully you will find that in here, if you didn’t know already about the antagonist’s emotional attachments, you won’t actually have anything to sympathize. But still, you will. From my part, yes you are permitted to cry after finishing the book, this one, rather than the likes of Fault in Our Stars (LOL!!)

Tokyo Metropolitan Police

In The Devotion of Suspect X, Ishigami and Yukawa try to outwit each other in this cops and robbers game. What Yukawa couldn’t fathom is the depth in which Ishigami is willing to devote himself to and ultimately sacrifice for Yasuko. This mystery is among the handful of mystery novels whose plots surprise me. And though I wish the key characters have more depth, the plot more than compensates for that flaw and the sparse prose pushes the plot along without extraneous verbiage. Smart and powerful. I almost wish Ishigami could triumph over Yukawa.

Wealthy businessman Yoshitaka Mashiba tells his wife Ayane that he's divorcing her because she hasn't become pregnant. He reminds Ayane this was the deal when they married - a baby on the way within a year or he looks for someone new.



Meanwhile Yoshitaka has been having an affair with Hiromi, Ayane's apprentice in the art of quilt making.



Heartbroken, Ayane goes off for the weekend to visit her parents. While she's away Yoshitaka is murdered with arsenic-laced coffee. The police suspect Ayane, but she has an ironclad alibi.



To add to their problems, the police can't figure out how the arsenic got into the coffee. Detective Kusanagi and his team question Yoshitaka's friends and acquaintances but have trouble advancing the case.



So the female detective on the team, Kaoru Utsumi, consults the brilliant physicist Yukawa, who's a whiz at solving difficult cases.



Eventually the ingenious murder method and the killer are uncovered. I liked the new slant on murder weapons but the resolution was not very believable or satisfying (to me).

All in all I thought the book read like a typical cozy, but I would have liked the characters to be more fully developed and more interesting. Still - for mystery fans - the book is a pleasant way to pass a few hours

review_603611064,Samadrita,"Apr 30, 2013","**A big thank you to Blogadda for kindly forwarding a review copy to me**

The task of reviewing a novel of the mystery-detective genre usually presents itself as a challenge to me. Not because it is hard to put into words what the story holds without giving away spoilers. But because a detective novel usually doesn't give a reviewer much to go on, aside from a mystery and its solution.
But despite being a book of the same genre, Salvation of a Saint, provides ample food for thought on the complexities of the human mind and offers the reader some philosophical meanderings to go with a regular offering of a mind-boggling mystery.

Without delay, let me get to the summary now.

Yoshitaka and Ayane Mashiba have been married for one year and yet their marriage is already falling apart. Why? Because turns out, both of them had agreed to treat marriage like a contractual agreement in which if Ayane fails to conceive a child within a year they will part ways. And, of course, Ayane has failed to conceive at the end of the stipulated time period.
So what happens next? Yoshitaka declares he is leaving her because he has already found prospective new baby-producer to replace Ayane. And it turns out that she is none other than Ayane's protege, Hiromi Wakayama, whose talent Ayane has helped hone herself.
And to put the cap on this madness, Yoshitaka gets killed in his apartment while Ayane is away in Sapporo on a visit to her parents and the detective in charge of the investigation falls for Ayane at first sight even though she becomes the chief suspect.
But then of course, she has a rock solid alibi. She was away from Tokyo when Yoshitaka was murdered.
How do you kill when you are physically hundreds of miles away from the scene of the crime?

Here in lies the novelty of Salvation of a Saint. It's not a whodunit as much as it is a howdunit.

To me the real villain of the story remains the victim and not the murderer. Because men who treat women like baby-producing machines and switch to one from another as easily as changing clothes, deserve to be at least squarely kicked in their family jewels, if not murdered outright. And I'm pleased to find out there are no misogynistic undertones in this narrative since Higashino doesn't gloss over this fact.
Now for my verdict on Higashino as a writer:-

If you are acquainted with anime such as Death Note, Monster or Detective School Q (Tantei Gakuen Kyu), you are bound to know that the Japanese, being big fans of logical reasoning and the science of deduction, have a penchant for creating stories with a worthwhile mystery at its center. And Keigo Higashino upholds that cherished tradition with this well-plotted novel.
He excels at creating a mystery which appears convoluted and unsolvable at the outset, but when it unravels slowly and all the pieces of the puzzle start falling into their place, the solution doesn't baffle one as much as the killer's dedication towards the very act of the murder does.

But I have a bone to pick with the translation - it doesn't always do a good job of capturing the true cadence of Japanese speech and the awkward sentence construction feels jarring at times.

A significant thing about this book is instead of one detective giving it his all to solve a murder, it gives you 3.
The detective in charge of the investigation, Kusanagi finds his judgement dangerously clouded by his growing fascination for Ayane. While his assistant Kaoru Utsumi, stubbornly convinced of the fact that Ayane is the killer, seeks out physics professor cum detective extraordinaire, Manabu Yukawa aka Detective Galileo to help her out.
But even while pursuing separate leads, all 3 of them arrive at the same answer.

The characters are not badly sketched caricatures but appear as people who could actually exist. The calmness of Ayane's demeanour even under suspicion, Utsumi's doggedness, Yukawa's brilliance and Kusanagi's quiet dignity shine through.

Kusanagi and Yukawa's friendship, rivalry and the grudging respect they have for each other add another dimension to the story. And it reminds one of the Lestrade and Holmes equation because like Lestrade, Kusanagi is the one getting the credit even though most of the work is done by Yukawa. Although a comparison between Lestrade and Kusanagi won't be fair since the former was essentially a pompous idiot while Kusanagi is balanced and reasonable.
It is also interesting to take note of Kusanagi's increasing concern over his own evaluation of the murder and the subsequent investigation - is he being objective or is he being too judgemental? and how does one stop his personal feelings from getting in the way of his professional assessment of a scenario?
His inner turmoil leads him to ponder over what makes a person commit a murder and the effect it has on their personality:-

""Kusanagi had met plenty of good, admirable people who'd been turned into murderers quite by circumstance. There was something about them he always seemed to sense, an aura that they shared. Somehow, their trangression freed them from the confines of mortal existence, allowing them to perceive the great truths of the universe. At the same time, it meant they had one foot in forbidden territory. They straddled the line between sanity and madness.""


Lastly, this novel also dares to analyze the not-so-flattering shades of a woman's personality and how one woman is sometimes another woman's worst enemy - how an act of betrayal may cause a woman to seek out vengeance with a resolute, perverse passion.

Hence an impressed 3 stars.
Highly recommended to lovers of mysteries and it doesn't hurt either if you are a fan of Japanese literature in addition to that.

P.S:- I apologize for not shedding any light on how the title of the book relates to the murder or the core of the story. But to do that would be to reveal the crux of the story itself, which would be doing the future reader a grave injustice.

review_2401357424,Nandakishore Mridula,"May 25, 2018","Every classic mystery is a magic trick - it works through misdirection. While the magician entices us to watch something in the open, his quicksilver hands does the business out of sight, and we are mystified at the apparent breakdown of the rules of nature. ""The hand is quicker than the eye."" In the mystery story, it is the same - we are persuaded to chase the red herrings while the writer cleverly builds up his plot under wraps. The only difference is, unlike the magic trick, the novelist tells us how it was done at the end.

Keigo Higashimo's ""The Devotion of Suspect X"" was a classic in this aspect. ""Malice"" was also good, though by then I could sense how his particular style of sleight-of-hand was carried out. In ""Salvation of the Saint"", however, the style is slightly different.

As with ""Devotion..."", the murderer is pretty clear from the beginning. The focus in a Higashimo novel is not as much on ""whodunnit"" as ""howdunnit"". In this aspect, he resembles the great Dorothy Sayers (for example, the novels ""Strong Poison"", ""Unnatural Death"" etc.) - it is impossible for the most likely person to have committed the murder: yet it was done.

When Yoshitaka Washiba is murdered by poison in his coffee, his beautiful wife Ayane is the obvious suspect - especially since Yoshitaka had declared his intention of leaving her and marrying her young apprentice Hiromi Wakayama. The problem is, Ayane is hundred of kilometres away when the murder happens, as per the testimony of Hiromi herself. It is left to Detective Kusanagi to unravel the mystery, all the while fighting the strong attraction Ayane exercises over him. However, he has Professor Yukawa of Tokyo University (""Detective Galileo""), who solves cases like problems in physics: constructing hypotheses and testing them.

There is no long trail of false clues in this story - the whole thing boils down to how the poison was introduced into the coffee. But while the method is brilliant and there is a logical explanation for all the doubts it gives rise to, I felt slightly disappointed here as I partly guessed where the poison was, and how it was disposed off. As any mystery which is amenable to deduction by the reader disappoints me, I wouldn't rate this as high as his other novels I have read.

Still, an extremely enjoyable and well-written mystery, with memorable characters. I am getting to be a fan of Detective Galileo.",3,48 likes,4
review_2355458860,carol.,"Apr 08, 2018","The second mystery I've read by Higashino was even better than my first (The Devotion of Suspect X). There is something immensely satisfying about his approach to telling a story. Perhaps it is a difference of cultural expectations on what an author needs to accomplish. Though Higashino is a best-selling author in Japan, he seems relatively unknown in the U.S. What I do know is that when I finish, I feel a strong sense of pleasure. The mystery is resolved, yes, providing a sense of intellectual satisfaction; but there's also an artistic sense of pleasure, as from seeing a play performed by skilled actors.

""Kusanagi walked in through the glass doors and up to the sales counter. He had heard that the store stocked over fifty varieties of tea, and sure enough, there they were, all individually labeled and sorted into neat rows. Behind the counter was a little tea room. Even at the relatively quiet hour of four in the afternoon, he saw a few customers scattered around the cafe, sipping tea and reading newspapers. One or two were dressed in company uniforms. Male customers were definitely in the minority.""

Like Agatha Christie, Higashino makes use of traditional or iconic set-pieces, but is wise enough to let the setting be the background to the story, albeit an important one. The main characters are all treated well, with hints at complexity but not in a way that overshadows the plot. There are no scenic digressions of them having a lonely beer at the local bar, or getting their hair cut at the stylist. Kusanagi is the lead detective, and now has a female member of his team, Utsumi, along with his long-term aide, Kishitani:

""Kusanagi suppressed a smile as he looked at his two subordinates. Poor Kishitani had finally got a new recruit of his own to push around--and it was a woman. He has no idea how to handle her.""

They are working to solve the case of a man found dead in his locked home, a spilled coffee cup by his side. Is it natural? An accident? Suicide? Homicide? As they work to tease out the possibilities, they end up with an impossible situation. However, nothing is impossible when the physicist Yukawa is consulted:

""It's not very scientific to say things like 'absolutely' and 'zero possibility.' It's also rather unorthodox to say someone made a mistake when they've only presented a hypothesis that proved to be incorrect. But I'll forgive you on the grounds that you're not a scientist.""

I love the irreverent and infallibly logical Yukawa. He is not so much the associate with the little grey cells as the analytical counterpoint to the intuition-driven doggedness of Detective Kusanagi.

The first book I read was about how the police uncovered a murder (we knew the who, what, why and how). In this, though the reader has a strong suspicion who the murderer is and why, there's enough doubt on the who to keep the reader wondering, and of course, the how is a puzzle indeed.

Satisfying is really one of the best words I can come up with for this tale. It perhaps stretches, just slightly, the boundaries of imagination, and yet Higashino makes this story plausible. I enjoyed the way the emotions of the story tugged at me without descending into the maudilin or horrific, as well as Higashino's complete failure to include car chases, ominous but missed hints from the criminals as they pack their bombs, and dire threats to end the world as the detective almost fails to catch them in time. I know, I know; I'm overusing that word, satisfying. But I can't think of a better way to describe a work that intrigued me and captured my attention without resorting to narrative or plotting tricks.

Four, five stars. Really could be either. If anything keeps it from five, it is that I do not feel the drive--not quite--to add this to my own library. Although I'd consider reading it again. Rounding up for that.",5,146 likes,4

I have no idea why it took me so long to get back to this series, when I enjoyed The Devotion of Suspect X so much!

It may be a case of ""Ooh look, shiny!"" as new books cross my Goodreads path, but it is more likely that the number of group reads I do & my devotion to twentieth century fiction crowd even the ablest of modern writers out. Which is, of course, a pity.

But better late than never!

Devotion of Suspect X made me think of Shogi


This book features both chess


and badminton


It isn't subtle (nothing about this book is) but it shows the value of keeping fit mentally and physically.

One of the main characters is a Japanese quilter. I know nothing about this sub craft ( I guess you would call it) but I certainly looked at some beautiful examples.



This one might be closer to the style of Ayane's work.



This art form is definitely the work of careful planner. And Ayane is indeed a planner!

It may also be the translation, but some of the points are very heavy handed.

Still, don't give up. I definitely got a surprise at the end!

review_1114627198,Carol,"Nov 24, 2014","Salvation of a Saint is the second Higashino novel I've read in as many weeks. It takes place in Japan and is a masterful police procedural featuring several police detectives and the ever-fabulous physics professor Yukawa solving what appears initially to be the perfect crime. One of the things I love about Higashino's novels is that they reflect a uniquely Japanese style and temperament. The aggressive/confrontational interrogation tactics typical of American detective novels and movies is nowhere to be found. There's a politeness in every interaction between the detectives and suspects. If there's a little tension, it's between and among the detectives jockeying for position to be the one to solve the crime.

Salvation of a Saint presents an unsympathetic murder victim and, initially, a particularly sympathetic potential perpetrator. It's a detective novel for those who like their solutions challenging - the more puzzle-oriented readers - the how, as it were, and also want to be presented with a ""why"" that makes sense based on human nature. Higashino scored on both points in this novel. Finally, his pacing is sublime. I stayed up far later than I should have to read this one night because Higashino has figured out how to drive the reader to read just one more chapter. And one more. And one more. I can't recommend Salvation of a Saint enough, if more complex detective novels are your thing.",5,,4

Here, the author reveals the murderer in the first chapter, and we then spend the entire book trying to see how she did it and wondering if we've been fooled and she didn't, only to facepalm at the end. I've read three of these in a row, I really should start to see the twists coming, but no.

This one also has a lot to think about re some fairly toxic gender attitudes not unknown in Japan. Cracking reads.",0,30 likes,4
review_464785798,Crystal Bryant,"Nov 27, 2012","I was completely captured by Higashino's previous book, The Devotion of Suspect X, and pre-ordered Salvation of a Saint as soon as I heard about it.

It exceeded my expectations. How do you keep your readers interested in a murder mystery when the murderer is revealed at the very beginning of the book?
1) By making the execution of the murder so devious that it will need the input of ""Detective Galileo"", a modern day, Japanese Sherlock, to reveal it.
2) By writing the murderer and the investigators in such a way that you empathize with both sides, and the conflict is lifted from the story and lodged somewhere between your throat and your stomach as well as within the pages of the book.

One of the things I'm really coming to appreciate Higashino is that while his stories focus on the technical genius of the murders, he gives equal weight to the emotions behind the murder. And the revelation of those emotions, the driving events, are just as important as the how of it all.

I really hope they start to translate his earlier Galileo novels into English.",5,75 likes,4

“Sometimes it's as important to prove there is no answer to a question as it is to answer it.”

It was the second work that I read by Higashino, with my expectations set higher after his probably most famous work. An unwise decision, perhaps, to read an author’s most acclaimed work before dealing with his others, but I didn’t regret it, for sure.

The story revolves around a middle-aged hypocrite who was going to divorce his wife, for “failing” to “give” him a baby, which wasn’t his fault for he had gone through the medical check-up himself. And soon after that, he was found lying dead in his abode, by arsenic poisoning, and the suspicion fell, quite obviously on his wife. However, she was verified to be hundreds of miles away at that time, and hence our beloved Physics Professor Manabu Yukawa was called to look into the matter.

Written in a bit of Christie-like whodunnit style, the storytelling often can remind you of her Mysterious Affairs At Styles, though in a modern, and bit differently complicated manner. The ending may seem a bit unrealistic, but definitely a treat. However, this little bit imitative way of storytelling doesn’t allow this work to be as great as it’s sequel. But still, I will highly recommend this one to all lovers of this genre. Kusanagi and Yukawa’s conversations, at times are well enough to provide a bit of relief from the serious tone and pace of the story. Yoshitaka’s outlook of the society, and women’s role in marriage, can remind you of Atwood’s Handmaid’s Tale; a simultaneously disgusting and ridiculous way of perceiving for a ‘modern’ guy. Truth be told, we are actually always surrounded by guys who think like this, and even now there’s none to mould the thoughts.

So, a thriller, packed with bits of important (relevant) social messages, that not for an instance feels preachy? Also, an awesome translation, that proved to me more readable than even Murakami. I hardly remember anything that I had read almost 3 years ago, but this story sheds some much needed light on a silent antagonist of immense character, one that can’t be easily forgotten. No need to speak anything on the crime-solving skills of Yukawa, we don't call him ""Galileo"" for no reason. And quite like the other works of the series, you won’t be amazed by the “who?”, as much as you will be by the “how?”

Definitely recommended. However, it’s not that excellent. Good, undoubtedly, but not even close to his best. Rather, doesn’t feel that authentic , but just as some good modern-day crime thriller will do.

review_2166599775,Patrick Sherriff,"Oct 28, 2017","I don't recommend this book if you are trying to cut down on caffeine. I say this as someone who drinks far too much coffee for his own good. I decided to knock coffee on the head for a week. The same week, by chance, I started listening to the audiobook of Salvation of a Saint. On day one, I had terrible headaches and a real craving for the smell and taste of filter coffee. And then I found, much to my chagrin, the victim keels over from a cup of poisoned coffee and all I could think about was coffee. In fact, the the whole novel revolves around coffee, or how the poison got in to the coffee. Every day for a week as I struggled to detoxify my body, I listened to detectives experimenting with coffee filters, debating whether mineral or tap water went into the coffee and who had the last cup?

Well, it wan't me.

Anyway, when I could drag my mind away from my addiction, I found the book's tastiest elements were the blend of characters -- our hero cop who falls for the femme fatale, his sidekick female junior detective who decidedly doesn't fall for suspect no. 1, and the professor who hovers Spock-like over all the bickering parties offering sage advice to follow the clues to their logical conclusion. At times I found the whodunnit puzzle a little too tedious and our hero's infatuation with the suspect not strongly convincing, but it was all palatable enough. The audiobook narrator was very good, although his pronunciation of Japanese place names was sometimes - how you say? - distracting. Nevertheless, on the whole, a concoction worth savouring.

review_2549078993,Bharath,"Oct 09, 2018","I read Keigo Higashino’s “The Devotion of Suspect X” on a recommendation from a friend sometime back and really liked. Since then, I read “Malice” and now “Salvation of a Saint”. The strength is in the depth of the story and the characters. They are all great crime novels with no fluff or unnecessary drama.

Salvation of a Saint is another great story if you like crime/mysteries. It is not as crisply written as the other two books mentioned above, but a very good read nevertheless.

Yoshitaka and his wife Ayane are about to separate from their marriage. As Ayane is visiting her parents, Yoshitaka dies mysteriously – as a result of drinking coffee laced with poison. Yoshitaka has not been exactly faithful, and based on that it seems that his wife has the strongest motive to kill him, but she is away during that period. Ayane’s work colleague Hiromi is the last to have seen Yoshitaka.

Police detective Kusanagi and his assistant Utsumi investigate the case. It is puzzling as it is unclear where the poison came from. Utsumi turns to Professor Yukawa for help. It seems to be the perfect crime – with no evidence to lead anywhere.

The reasoning of the police and Professor Yukawa is a delight to read, as they persevere with testing one hypothesis after the other. In many ways, I suppose this is how great mysteries are really solved – one step at a time.",4,18 likes,4
review_2526777188,Apoorva,"Nov 07, 2018","It seems like the end of 2018 is gonna be ‘Keigo Higashino’ year for me and I’m not complaining! Salvation of a Saint is another impressive novel, a successor of the Devotion of Suspect X in the thriller series 'Detective Galileo'. This book revolves around a perfect crime: a crime which is so proficiently crafted that it leaves no evidence or trace behind to pinpoint the criminal; the unsolvability of the crime depends on the skill of the criminal rather than the incompetence of the investigator.

The mystery here begins with the murder of a businessman Yoshikata Mashiba who’s killed in his apartment alone with a poison-laced coffee. We later learn that the victim had made up his mind to divorce his wife so, the wife is a logical suspect here, as there scarcely appears anyone else who had a definite motive and who might have constructed such a scheme to end Yoshikata. The thing is the murder was committed when the wife was miles away which would make it impossible to carry out.

Unfortunately, our lead detective Kusanagi is enchanted by the wife and denies any allegations against her. Seeing his judgment getting clouded due to his feelings for the dead man’s wife, his assistant Utsumi secretly approaches Professor Manabu Yukawa, famously known as 'Detective Galileo' to assist in the investigation, as the events happened in the previous book has created a rift between the two friends. But, even Yukawa has a hard time decoding this one. It leads the two friends to split in different directions and pursue different paths to find the killer. What follows is the elaborate observation of the clues to rule out different possibilities to get to the heart of the crime.

This book is well detailed and cleverly constructed and the information is disclosed one step at a time with tiny twists. The characters are likable and witty. The plot is very simple. Turning a simple plot into a complex story is the forte of the author! There’s never a dull moment and it’s hard to put down the book. Even though the identity of the criminal is revealed in the first few pages, you need not worry, as it does not hinder the mystery. Even as I was reading and was absolutely sure about something, I was led astray by the revelation of new clues and information which made me doubt myself so much. And, the ending just blew my mind! This book attempts to stretch the boundaries of your imagination and makes you marvel at the complexity of the human mind.

All in all, this book was awesome! Not as good as the previous one but excellent in its own way. I highly recommend it to the fans of thrillers.",5,26 likes,4
review_552926086,Amit,"Mar 05, 2013","There's nothing more scary than the truth that hides in plain sight.

First of all, what makes this this murder mystery an interesting read,
1. By the end of the 1st chapter, you will know who committed the murder.
2. By the end of the 2nd chapter, you will know what happened to the victim (as we always do).

BUT

3. It will take close to 300+ pages to find out exactly how the victim was murdered.

When one picks up a murder mystery, one might expect an extremely elaborate plan to murder, motives that can sometimes go back decades and if I'm lucky maybe even a weird weapon of choice.
With slight modification to one of the above 3 elements, I'd say, the book excels on all 3 grounds.

When I finished reading the first 2 chapters in the book and realized that there are more than 300 pages remaining, I knew I was getting into something highly complex. And boy, was I not disappointed. The novels continues on with the detectives going about their regular work, questioning anything that moved.

The murder plan was extremely simple, but complex enough to keep the reader guessing till the end. Even crazy, if not mind boggling and the motive was quite obvious from page 5, though the reason was not. Keigo is definitely well on his way (after reading this book, a long way) from becoming the next Arthur Conan Doyle, the reason for which I shall now explain.

Keigo has definitely done a great job by concentrating more on the case than on the characters themselves, especially from those in the police department. But as a reader of his previous work, The Devotion of Suspect X, i believe, he hasn't given us a character who can be described as the Japanese Sherlock Holmes. Throughout the book, I was confused as to whether Manabu Yukawa or Shumpei Kusanagi were playing the part of the main protagonists, once thing the author should have kept in mind when he reintroduced the characters from his previous work. My above statement is highly evident from the fact that since Yukawa is the one who mainly decodes the case, he is hardly given any spotlight at all. I hope the author improves on this in his next work.

Normally, after writing an entire paragraph on what's wrong with this book, I would give a rating in the range of 2-3 stars but the overall simplicity of the murder plot won me over, and thus I'm compelled to give this book a 4 star rating.

And under normal circumstances, I would refrain from the idea of turning this novel into a movie since they basically alter the plot line which can seriously piss the reader off. But this case deserves an exception. After watching The Devotion of Suspect X on screen and how closely it follows the plot line. I will admit that I am eagerly looking forward to the movie adaptation of this book.

For the Indian Reader

The mass market paperback version of this book is available at great discounts across many online retailers. But, I would recommend buying the book from Infibeam , for the simple fact that they don't charge extra delivery fees for shipping anywhere in India, and that their delivery timings are on par with that of FlipKart (Seriously pissed off at them right now).",4,17 likes,4

review_1432684742,Jeanette,"Nov 03, 2015","These Keigo Higashino are fixed within a common mystery/detective genre, but hold a singular Japanese style which quite changes the formula. It alters difference in feel, approach, confrontation, reflecting the over culture well. But that exact point of style in particular is also a factor to why many readers of impatience or other faster paced and less repetitious to manners sensibilities would not persevere to the end. Many Westerners will pale at the repeating language. Exact words in plot progression repeated. And repeated.

This one held some deep characterizations. Three people in a romance triangle of sorts and technical savvy to HOW the crime was committed is the focus of the entire book. But what is plunged, is plunged to immense degree.

From the get-go, as in other Higashino works, you are plucked right into the action of the crime. You know where and to whom. And the entire remaining 280 pages is to figure out why and how. The two main ""sleuthers"" are static in that they are solid for the entire series, but on occasion there is emotive underlayment. Which is particularly hard to detect and to communicate in this modern Japanese placement. There are probably one hundred methods of asking for permission or for proclaiming some form or movement towards expressing ""I'm sorry""- for instance.

But the answer in this one was rather a one trick pony. And the deep malicious nature wasn't revealed in any part until nearly the absolute end. So I thought this one was a good read 3 star for Japanese best seller detective beat. Although most is in Tokyo, this one had some travel to the North and to Hiroshima within the plot. That and the train portions were interesting too.

I can't imagine a suspect, a perp, or a murderer of any major crime in my own culture ever being as polite as any of these people routinely are and continue to be throughout their investigations.",3,11 likes,4

I needed to remove the 1 star rating that I had awarded to this book and add this edit to my original review. Cause, after persistent prodding by the fellow Goodreaders to explore other works of the author before judging unfairly, I took up two other books of Keigo Higashino. And I must admit, he is a master of this crime-thriller genre. I absolutely loved his other 2 books - The Devotion of Suspect X and Malice.
And now I have a feeling that if I again read 'Salvation of a Saint', it would get more than 1 star that I awarded before.

Apologies to Higashino fans for my hurried and unthoughtful previous review.

(Original Review April 30 2014)

The tag ""Japanese Stieg Larrson"" did me in.
It made me fall for this book and wasted 3-4 hours of my life that I am not going to get back.
I was not exactly expecting a 'Crime and Punishment' here. But, tell me, if it is unfair to expect a 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' from the ""Japanese Stieg Larrson"".

Even if I am not particularly a big fan of Larrson (well, I didn't like the latter 2 books in the Millennium series as much as the first one), but comparing Higashino to Larrson is like comparing Chetan Bhagat to Haruki Murakami or Rohit Shetty to Stanley Kubrick. …. OK….OK...I agree, may be I exaggerated a bit. But, I guess you got my point.",0,12 likes,4
review_433524308,Ms.pegasus,"Oct 13, 2012","This unconventional mystery has at its core a playful consideration of gender stereotypes. From page 1, the victim, Yoshitaka Mashiba, is a preening narcissist unapologetic about his misogyny. The book opens with his reiteration of his so-called 'life's plan'. The only purpose of marriage is to have children. It's been a year, and his wife Ayane is still not pregnant. Her time is up, he announces, while at the same time chiding her for her unsympathetic attitude toward this setback in this goal. He will be divorcing her.

Ayane, on the other hand, is portrayed as the model housewife. She manages everything, including cooking elaborate meals when they entertain guests. Her husband's business associate Tatsuhiko Ikai sums it up: “ 'She was the perfect wife, you know. Utterly dedicated to him whenever he was home, she would sit there on the living room sofa, doing her patchwork, ready to serve if he needed anything. Not that he ever appreciated her. To him, a woman who couldn't bear children was no more useful than a trophy on the wall — just taking up space.'” (p.135)

In addition to being a devoted wife, Ayane is also an acclaimed artistic talent. Her hand-sewn quilts with their vibrant designs and colors have success in gallery exhibitions, and the atelier she heads has many talented students. One of her quilts might easily sell for over a million yen ($9000+)! Yet, she may as well be invisible. Her husband is uninterested in her work. The detectives have never even heard that patch-work quilting is an art form. Even Tatsuhiko for all his sophistication is surprised “that something made out of little bits of cloth sewn together could cost so much.” (p.11)

The other prominent female character in this book is Kaoru Utsumi. She is a young detective with strong instincts and astute observations. Despite drawing criticism from her superior, Detective Kusanagi, she is outspoken in her suspicions. She is the “nail that sticks out” but instead of being hammered down, their chief, Mamiya, is supportive. After a rebuke by Kusanagi, he interjects: “ 'What's the point having our new detective on the team if she doesn't feel at ease sharing her observations with us, hmm?'” (p.83) Utsumi goes much further than merely voicing her conjectures. She seeks out Manabu Yukawa, physics professor and former classmate of Kusanagi to help find the physical evidence that would support her position. Yukawa has been consulted in numerous police cases in the past — so much so that his nickname is Detective Galileo. Readers of Higashino's previous novel, THE DEVOTION OF SUSPECT X, will recall Yukawa's prominent role in that book. Here, he has a lesser role and does not even appear until page 102. Yukawa's character is in sharp contrast to the other characters. Whereas Utsumi is eager and enthusiastic, Yukawa is detached. Whereas Kusanagi is uncommonly polite (at least to American readers), Yukawa is brusque and disputatious. He is hardly charismatic, at least in this book. Perhaps this is because we do not see him through the admiring eyes of a Dr. Watson. It may be that these so un-Japanese eccentricities are what make Yukawa so popular with Japanese audiences.

Yukawa's contribution to this mystery is not his scientific knowledge but his impeccable dedication to logic: Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. The logic leads to two contradictory lines of investigation. There is no evidence of an unknown intruder, perhaps a past lover, who committed the murder. Does that mean there was no intruder? That is the line Kusanagi takes. He pursues this direction with stolid workmanlike devotion. The investigation expands to a widening circle of past connections to the victim. Yukawa adopts the position that even though there is no evidence, that doesn't prove his prime suspect is innocent. This is an unusual mystery. Instead of focusing on who?, it focuses on how? Whereas Yukawa is driven by his own curiosity, Utsumi is driven by the practical consideration that unless she finds proof, a murderer will have eluded justice. Kusanagi is driven by more internal considerations. He too has instincts and he wants to find the evidence that will put to rest his doubts.

Yukawa is also attentive to the danger of confirmation bias. When he directs Utsumi to ask a list of questions he refuses to disclose his theory until after she has provided the answers to him.

Another unique characteristic of this novel is that because of our dislike of the victim, the perpetrator is shown in a sympathetic light. “Kusangai had met plenty of good, admirable people who'd been turned into murderers by circumstance. There was something about them he always seemed to sense, an aura that they shared. Somehow, their transgression freed them from the confines of a mortal existence, allowing them to perceive the great truths of the universe.”(p.207) It's an odd perspective for a detective.

Although the writing keeps the reader at a distance, I liked the insights into Japanese culture glimpsed in this book, as well as the ingenious and disturbing solution. For those reasons, I give it four stars.

review_2414362865,Tim,"Jun 07, 2018","While I never reviewed it, I really enjoyed the previous book (at least in terms of English translations… this series has some weird release gaps) The Devotion of Suspect X. I really see no need to go back and review it now, as the reasons I liked it are much the same for this novel, so I would mostly be just repeating myself.

This series is unique. I don’t know if it is because I’m new to Japanese Police Procedural novels or if it Higashino’s writing (my initial guess would be both) but this series is refreshingly different. First off, the police are so polite that it comes off as nothing like most American crime novels. They hand out business cards, they apologize every time they call on the phone to ask a question, hell they even water a suspect’s plants when the suspect is not at home. It’s just such an oddity, but a refreshing one to compare to the all business, don’t care if they bother you attitude I’m used to in such works.

The other thing I love about these books is that they are not “who done its”. You know from the opening chapters who did it, the question is “HOW THE HELL DID THEY DO IT?!?!” While we know who the killer is, Higashino is so skilled at his killer’s methods and alibies that much like the detectives in the novel, we sit there baffled. We know they did it, but it doesn’t seem physically possible! Surely he’s cheating and this isn’t a “fair play” mystery! Then the solution is presented and you realize that clues were given all along, so subtly and beautifully that it’s stunning it wasn’t obvious.

Of the two novels in the series I’ve read, I personally enjoyed this one better. I gave both a 4 star rating, this one though I debated on a 5 star. I decided not to simply because some aspects I wasn’t satisfied with (for example how things would end if it actually went to court), but overall I found this a more enjoyable story and an excellent detective novel. It managed to create a sympathetic killer, which made me have mixed emotions over whether or not I even wanted the case solved. The layers this story creates are delightful and gives us multiple characters with conflicting viewpoints yet all distinctly likable.

I get the pattern of Keigo Higashino novels. First, we come to know the crime and then the next moment we get to know the criminal but what we won’t know is the reason behind it and these kinds of mysteries is what I love to read. Where rather than concentrating on who is the criminal, the plot is more about why and how it was done.

Ayane and Yoshitaka a married couple, don't have children even after trying. But Yoshitaka is so adamant about having his own child that he doesn’t mind divorcing his current wife and remarrying. Meanwhile, he is also having a secret affair with one of Ayane students Hiromi. And when Yoshitaka is poisoned to death in mysterious circumstances (by the way, I certainly didn’t feel pity for him) it made me curious to know why and how it was done. Then enters Detective Kusanagi, his intelligent assistant Utsumi and Professor Manabu Yukawa and solves the mystery for us.

But still, some things put me off. Firstly, Kusanagi’s soft corner for the suspect (Ayane), maybe he just pretended to be interested in her am not sure of it but that part was unnecessary it somewhere made him look like a fool. Secondly, there was a lot of beating around the bush. The crime was there, the criminal was there too and they knew how it was done but still, it took a really long time for them to conclude, even though there were 3 intelligent people involved that made the whole reasoning a bit silly and the criminal more intelligent. Having said that I still enjoyed this book and will look forward to reading books by this author.

review_475608352,Diane S ☔,"Dec 11, 2012","This is only the second detective story I have read set in Japan. It is amazing, the many difference in the tone and writing of the various stories set in different countries. The British mysteries are very detailed, slower moving and atmospheric. The Nordic mysteries are very stark, the writing blunt and somewhat colder somehow. The Japanese seem to like puzzle mysteries, very matter fact writing, with very little emotion shown. I find it quite fascinating just as I found this novel. It is more of a how did they do it and how do we prove it type of story. Love the character of the psychics professor who helps the police dept. with unsolvable crimes and has an unquenchable curiosity. The story was very good and I will definitely read this authors next offering.",3,10 likes,4

review_623422089,Maria,"May 24, 2013","Keigo Higashino, who teased readers worldwide with his novel THE DEVOTION OF SUSPECT X about a year ago is back again with a new novel to tease again, intrigue again and keep readers turning the pages until the very end. The author known as 'the Japanese Stieg Larsson' has a reputation to maintain and he's certainly doing a good job of maintaining it.

True, it was an English playwright, Congreve, who said that hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. But this is a universal phenomenon. When the person you love stops loving you, it's a betrayal of all you've shared. When that person is about to leave you for a friend of yours and tries to twist things round to make it look like it's your fault, the betrayal can be absolute and unforgiveable. Ayane's husband Yoshitaka had told her that without children, their life together could not go on. For Ayane, grieving inwardly for her failure to bear a child, the fact that her partner turns away from her rather than standing by her in that dark moment makes a terrible retribution inevitable. Yoshitaka is found dead and Ayane is far from the scene. Who poisoned this man?

Who knows the truth about this apparently happy couple and their life together? Their friends Yukiko and Tatsuhiko who had recently produced their first child and had received a beautiful, handmade gift from Ayane, a talented crafter? Hiromi, Ayane's assistant and Yoshitaka's secret lover? Yoshitaka, the victim, elicits no sympathy, the arrogant male who was so ready to cast off his hapless wife for a newer , younger model, as one would trade in a car. As a woman, it made me furious. Why is it that in every society in the world women seem to have a 'use before' date? Ayane, the woman betrayed, seems so vulnerable. But is Ayane really what she seems to be on the surface? The answers, which must be unraveled by Detective Kusanagi, may not be be as simple and straightforward as originally envisaged.

We meet an assortment of complex characters. What sort of man can be so unselfish that he turns away from a loving wife because she has failed to bear a child? What sort of woman can betray no emotion as the emotional blows are dealt out and treat revenge as a dish eaten cold? What sort of girl can cold bloodedly steal the husband of a woman who has befriended her? Detective Kusanagi has his work cut out for him. Detective Kusanagi's assistant, a female detective, is a delightful character, providing feminine insight into the whole sorry business, a crime involving two women. I do hope what I'm hearing is the author's original voice. Translated works may be technically perfect but they sometimes lose their fresh originality. I very much enjoyed the light touches of humour in the dialogue.

This is the second novel I've read by Keigo Higashino and I can honestly say that along with a talent for telling a story with layers and twists aplenty, he gives a fascinating glimpse into Japanese society, often considered complex and inscrutable by outsiders. A society where people are struggling to find some happiness and some meaning other than going about the daily grind. Would a child have given meaning and joy to the marriage of Yoshitaka and Ayane? Who can know that? Once I pick up a book by this author, I cannot leave it down. I generally like to wait until I have at least two or three free hours, which has been impossible lately owing to problems with work and family. Yet once I picked this up I couldn't leave it. This book has the same fascination as THE DEVOTION OF SUSPECT X. The same adrenaline rush as the book hurtles towards its inevitable - yet unexpected - conclusion. The word 'compulsive' springs to mind.

As in the case of the previous book, I found the cluster of Japanese names a little less than easy to get my head around and repeat to the publishers that a character list at the opening of the book would be great, if they could arrange it for future editions. .

Yet in the end one can only say that east or west, Europe or Asia, society to society, ordinary men and women deal with the problems of life as they see fit, depending on their circumstances and cultural backgrounds. The local can very much be the universal, depending on which way we view circumstances.

Do I recommend this book? Yes, I do.",4,8 likes,4
review_568121774,Soham Chakraborty,"Mar 22, 2013","Here comes the second thriller of Keigo Higashino, who I have fallen in awe with, after the jaw-dropping end of Devotion of Suspect X. I will start off this review telling that, if you haven't read the first one till now, please do yourself a favour and read that. I would put that novel beside The Millennium Trilogy. Higashino hasn't got the nick 'Japanese Stieg Larsson' for free.

First a question. How would you keep your readers glued to a crime story where in the first chapter you have declared whodunnit. Simple, read 'Salvation of a Saint' and you will keep the pages turning yourself. The story starts with a conversation of Ayane Mita and Yoshitaka Mashiba, married for around one year by now. Yoshitaka wants a child and while marriage, he laid his plan clear to Ayane, that is, if she can't bear an offspring within an year, they would have to cut the tie. In the very first conversation in the book, Yoshitaka again says this to Ayane and she is left wondering whether her husband really loved her or not. And while they go downstairs to meet their guests of that night, Ayane utters to herself, 'I love you but I will also kill you'.

And it happens. Ayane goes to visit her home town, more than thousand miles apart from the upscale city of Tokyo. She gives the house key to her best student and apprentice, Hiromi Wakayama. After Ayane leaves, Hiromi gets a call from Yoshitaka and we get to know that Ayane's husband is also the lover of her student. Together on that night, they drink coffee made by Yoshitaka. Since Ayane, who used to use the kitchen as her castle, has left, next morning Hiromi makes the coffee while Yoshitaka observes the rules of ideal coffee making. Next day, she gets another call from her lover and they agree to have dinner from a restaurant. She goes to Yoshitaka's residence when her call goes unanswered and she finds Yoshitaka dead, coffee spilled in the floor.

The charge of the investigation comes to Tokyo metropolitan police and soon detective Kusangi enters the house. This time, he has another assistant along with Kishitani, detective Utsumi, a rookie young woman. They have two suspects - Hiromi and Ayane. While Hiromi was taking classes throughout the day, Ayane is not even in the scene. So who did the murder, if it is indeed one.

The detectives soon find out that Yoshitaka died of arsenous acid laced coffee and so they are now formally into a homicide investigation. The question is looming on them. Who poisoned Yoshitaka Mashiba - CEO of a well-off company and where did the poison come from. They can't find traces of any kind of arsenic in the house. Soon, the investigation has no clue and both the suspects have an ironclad alibi.

Ayane Mita comes to Tokyo next day and on first sight, Kusangi is smitten of her. Kusangi with all the experience of his illustrious detective career, can't extract the information from Ayane, while Utsumi has fixed her sight on Ayane as the prime suspect. The two detectives develop a difference between them but none of them can move the investigation one inch and they have to turn to the brilliant Physics professor of Imperial university, Manabu Yukawa - Kusangi's classmate from college, who is long known in the police circle as detective Galileo.

But even Yukawa's extraordinary mind finds this coffee soaked murder mystery so beautifully plotted that it appears like a perfect crime. A crime where the criminal didn't intend to kill the target but kept it alive, until at the final point, the string is snapped. And it snaps so mysteriously that it forms a perfect circle, with no hole in it. But if this is a murder, someone is the murderer and who is that.

Higashino's earlier novel sported the clash of two genius scientists, one mathematician and one physicist. The outcome, Devotion of Suspect X, was touted as stunning, intricate and beguiling. This one, doesn't have the delicate maths and physics riddles of the former but it has a character development unlike no other crime story, where the central detective finds himself hopelessly attracted to the number one suspect, the other detective tries her wit's end to find any clue and Manabu Yukawa hangs his head down at the perfect crime. With countless side-plots, this is one hell of a ride, where the crime floats on the water, where the crime is deep into the filtration system of the kitchen and is inseparable from the coffee and as neatly woven as the wonderful tapestry made by Ayane.

If you like crime thrillers, you will be hooked to this beguilingly complex piece of a mystery to no end. It is one of the rare showcase of talent, enigma, reason and emotion, churned into salvation of the murderer, the detectives and of course, you, the reader.",5,8 likes,4

I wanted something like this and Higashino is one of my favs. His style is neat and his mystery is, well, very mysterious. Yukawa (""detective Galileo"") reminds me a lot of Sherlock Holmes and I don't think it's something accidental - even though his drug of choice is coffee and he's got a badminton racquet instead of a violin. One star plus for bringing lady police officer into the story - a couple of years ago I've read women were still a rare case in Japanese police departments, the best thing they could expect to happen to them professionally was loads of paper work and coffee making for their bosses... I wonder if it's a sci-fi element in this story or is it after a real life example? Anyways, really looking forward to read the next books - literally anything by Higashino.",5,9 likes,4
review_2104071949,Mobyskine,"Aug 27, 2017","I love Keigo's style a lot, he always make me go nervous after revealing who's the killer and go mysteriously wonder about how they will do the investigation later. The case seems so simple, suspect was obvious and yet Keigo was so great to keep me glued until the very last page.

The new girl detective really caught my eyes, so in love with her style of investigation. I was shocked with her conclusion about Kusanagi to Yukawa. I never thought Kusanagi would go personal on it, but he after all a human too. But I seriously love Utsumi!

""From a cup of coffee what dreams may bloom..."" all the mess started with a cup of coffee and it goes from impossible to possible. A human patience was totally surprising at a point. To wait for a year just for a perfect crime, that was something impressive and unthinkable. Love the plot though I'm a bit pissed off at Kusanagi most of the times-- the watering flowers scene gave me headache like you should know there's something wrong about it Mr Detective!

""If you're going for checkmate, better do it in one move, or you'll have a stalemate on your hands."" I'm falling head over heels for our Galileo. He's always on point and so cool. I love how Utsumi making him go curious about the case and helping them until the end. And still, the friendship between him and Kusanagi was something to admire.

review_2561606518,Theresa Alan,"Oct 15, 2018","3.5 rounded up. Newcomer refers to the detective who is new in town and trying to solve the case of the murder of a forty-five-year-old divorced woman. If you like traditional, non-gory mysteries, you’ll like this story. In many detective novels, the cops have a grim, gritty disposition and possibly a drinking problem. Sergeant Kaga is downright friendly as he goes from shop to shop looking for small clues.

It turns out I’m not a huge fan of traditional, non-gory mysteries with affable detectives collecting evidence, but what made this novel not amazingly awesome to me was how many clichés there were. I’m sure it’s a function of translating from Japanese—I suspect that language also has clichés, but my guess is that they are different than those we English speakers sometimes use, and this translation abounds with them.

However, if you can ignore the clichés and like sweet (for a murder mystery) novels, you’ll enjoy Newcomer, which RELEASES NOVEMBER 20, 2018. Thanks so much to NetGalley and St. Martin’s Press for the opportunity to review this novel.

review_2582189757,Paromjit,"Nov 03, 2018","This is beautifully written, character driven translated Japanese crime fiction by Keigo Higashino featuring the razor sharp Sergeant Kyochiro Kaga, the eponymous Newcomer, recent arrival to Tokyo as a precinct detective. This is the 8th in the series, but it worked just fine as a standalone for me. In the district of Kodenmacho, a 45 year old divorced woman, Mineko Mitsui, has been discovered murdered in her apartment, strangled to death. No-one knows why she moved to the area, but she has been working as a translator with her friend, who found her body. If you are looking for a fast paced read, full of tension and suspense, then this is not for you. However, if you enjoy smart and intelligent crime fiction that is more cerebral, then this will definitely appeal.

The gentle, compassionate yet determined and steely Kaga works his way through a host of suspects in the business district of Nihonbashi. There is the insurance salesman, the odd instance of a wasabi spiked snack cake, a missing cell phone, the purchase of new kitchen scissors and chopsticks, a clock shop, a pastry shop and a china store. There are the rumours of a private secretary serving as a mistress and employed by Naohuso, Mineko's ex-husband, and the couple's estranged son, Koki, aiming to be a actor. As Kaga delves into the life of the murder victim, he unearths a case of mistaken identity and encounters the riddle of the strings of a spinning top. Kaga is a detective that impresses, understanding peoples foibles and the need to deceive in certain situations, and his astuteness does not go unnoticed by those he comes into contact with, although it takes a while for Detective Uesugi to cotton on just how deep Kaga's investigations go.

This is crime fiction with plenty of charm and intrigue, as well as providing insights into Japanese culture and the city of Tokyo. For me, I loved the way the author made the host of diverse and wide ranging characters come alive as distinct personalities with their own dramas. Sergeant Kaga makes an appealing central character, a tremendous judge of character, a man who insists on getting to the truth of the matter, even when it comes to identifying the true motives of the killer rather than accepting at face value what is said. The only flaw is that we get to know so little about Kaga himself, who he is, his background and his personal life. If you fancy some offbeat crime fiction that is entertaining and gripping, then this is for you. Many thanks to Little, Brown for an ARC.",4,88 likes,5
review_1997038573,Carol,"May 11, 2017","Newcomer is the seventh Higashino novel I've read and it was the perfect book at the perfect moment. Note that Higashino's novels are being translated into English in a seemingly haphazard fashion, so mystery readers compelled to read series in order must take a shot of their favorite beverage (or take any other action that works to calm one's nerves) and get over that compulsion. Yes, Newcomer is book 8 in the Detective Kaga series, but it's truly a standalone in every way.

Things you won't find and won't miss: Kaga has no back-story or even current-story. We know nothing about him other than the conclusions we draw from what he says to various characters and colleagues. No tension with a know-it-all supervisor. No unhappy divorce or custody battle. No substance abuse problem. No decades-old buddy-ship with a partner. He just does his job - solves the mystery of who killed the victim - and that's all folks. Pure bliss if you read a lot of contemporary mystery novels and, on occasion, roll your eyes at the amount of space occupied by all of the foregoing and tap your fingers impatiently waiting for the author to return to the main event - the mystery.

Higashino introduces us to a couple of dozen characters, unrelated to one another and in different neighborhoods, and developing them sufficiently with a minimum of context. (Thank goodness for the character list at the beginning.) He solved for the problem of having the detective spend half of the book traveling from one place and one witness to another. Kaga was simply in the next place - not magically, but efficiently. In other words, if you like your mysteries without any extra words or unrelated distractions, you'll be delighted.

One minor disappointment, however. This is the first Higashino novel I've read which takes the form of a traditional whodunnit. Part of what remains fresh and original about The Devotion of Suspect X, Salvation of a Saint, Journey Under the Midnight Sun et al. is that the reader knows who killed the victim/s, but is compelled to solve the puzzle of how he/she pulled off both the crime/s and the lack of evidence revealing the criminal to the authorities. Newcomer, on the other hand, represents a very good execution of the same plot as a ton of other mystery novels out there, a whodunnit, although Higashino's approach is several cuts above the majority of others.

For most mystery readers, there's nothing disappointing about a well-done murder mystery and I recommend Newcomer highly. For Higashino fans, Newcomer is unlikely to be your favorite, but it's decidedly a must-read and a solid entrant.

A pleasant surprise!

Fans of cozy mysteries or old school detective stories will love this one!!

Detective Kyoichiro Kaga has recently been transferred to the Nihonbashi precinct. He is immediately assigned to solve the murder of a divorced woman with ties to the Nihonbashi business district. To solve the mystery, he must interview people working in the neighborhood, all of whom have secrets, which may be a motive to commit murder.


I get book recommendations from so many sources, I often forget where I discover new books, but I do remember this author and this book series being advertised and promoted by Book Riot.

However, I had a devil of a time locating the first books in the series. Some are translated, some are not. A few are available in the library, but not from this series. So, I finally gave up and took a chance on this one, even though it is the eighth book in the series.


Turns out, this book can easily be read as a stand- alone. Doing a little research, I discovered this series and this author, are wildly popular in Japan. However, I still didn’t quite know what to expect.


Each segment is like a vignette, featuring a specific business owner or workers in Nihonbashi. Each has a connection with the murdered woman, and Kyoichiro Kaga methodically employs the process of elimination until he finally gets to the truth. Each story is compelling in its own way, and the characters all seem to discover a little something about themselves, or others, that gives them a fresh perspective.

I had to adjust to the format just a little, but soon caught on the method the author was using and found myself drawn deeper into the mystery as the story progressed.


Kyoichiro Kaga is very clever, with incredible powers of observation and the ability to draw people out and get them to confide in him. He is a bit like old school detectives, in that way. He’s charming, in a way, but his personality was a little bland. He didn’t have the fussiness of a Hercule Poirot or a dark side like Sherlock Holmes, for example. He needs a little more pizazz, but is otherwise a likeable character.

This clever mystery is centered more around the characterizations and is not in any way graphic or otherwise explicit. This format may appeal to cozy mystery fans as well, although I hate to label it as such due to the image most of us have of contemporary cozies.

All the same, if you like a good mystery solved without lurid details by a detective that uses his powers of deduction, over lab results and modern technologies, you will appreciate this little gem.

I doubt this series has what it takes to make the same impact here in the States as it has in Japan. It might even underwhelm those who balk at mysteries that aren’t action packed or loaded with grit, autopsy reports, and forensic details.

But I really enjoyed this book and found it to be quite interesting and a wonderful change of pace. I enjoyed it enough to add more of these stories into my TBR pile, if and when I can find them. I am especially interested in “The Devotion of Suspect X"", a book written by this author, but from a different series. That book was nominated for an Edgar award and the movie version was the third highest grossing film in Japan in 2008.

I think I may have discovered a new author to follow!!

In this 2nd book (that's been translated into English) in the 'Detective Kaga' series, the Tokyo homicide cop investigates the murder of a woman. The book can be read as a standalone.

*****



When a middle-aged woman named Mineko Mitsui is murdered in her apartment in the Kodenmacho district of Tokyo, homicide detective Kyoichiro Kaga - a newcomer to the local precinct - uses his Sherlockian skills to track down the killer.



Rather than zero in directly on the victim, Kaga starts by investigating oddities surrounding the case. These issues are connected to people who knew Mitsui, and specialty shops in the nearby Nihonbashi neighborhood. Thus Kaga interviews people and visits stores, day after day, to look into the following:

- The movements of Mitsui's insurance agent, Mr. Takura, who visited her on the day of the murder. Mr. Takura stopped at a rice cracker shop on his way to Kodenmacho, but the timeline of his movements doesn't add up, and Kaga has to figure out why.



- Ten snack cakes were found in Mitsui's apartment, seven with sweet bean paste filling and three without. One of the cakes had been doctored, and Kaga has to find out where the cakes were bought, who tampered with them, and why.




- Mitsui had recently purchased an expensive new pair of kitchen scissors from a cutlery shop, though she already had a serviceable pair of kitchen shears. Kaga needs to solve the puzzle of the second scissors.



- The owner of a clock repair shop, called Mr. Terada, would take his dog for a walk at 5:30 every afternoon. Mitsui often went out at the same time, and the two pedestrians would pass one another and nod hello. Mr. Terada seems to be mistaken about exactly where he saw Mitsui on the day of the murder, and Kaga needs to find out why.



- Mitsui would stop by a pastry shop every evening, where she would purchase cream puffs, her favorite sweets. Mitsui usually exchanged a few pleasantries with the bakery clerk, and even gave the girl a small 'good luck' gift. Kaga visits the pastry shop to speak to the girl.



- Mitsui was estranged from her twenty-year-old son Koki - an aspiring actor, and divorced from Koki's father Naohiro - a businessman. Though mother and son hadn't spoken in years, Mitsui moved to Koki's Kodenmacho neighborhood without informing her offspring - perhaps hoping to make amends.



Mitsui was also seeking to redraft her divorce settlement with Naohiro, in an effort to get more money.

Kaga looks into these matters.

- Mitsui had recently become reacquainted with an old college friend named Tamiko Yoshioka, who worked as a translator.



In college, Mitsui had also hoped to become a translator, and Tamiko promised to help Mitsui get translation work and get on her feet financially. Then Tamiko's situation changed, and she was planning to move away.....causing friction between the women. Kaga investigates this.

- Kaga visits the home of a young married couple, Reiko and Katsuya Kishida, who have a very lavish lifestyle.



The couple's little boy was recently gifted with a wooden top by his grandfather - who happens to be the business accountant for Mitsui's ex-husband. The wooden top doesn't work properly, and Kaga visits shops that sell these toys.



In the course of his investigation, Kaga gathers information and meets a wide variety of people - including store owners, shop employees, husbands, wives, in-laws, mothers, fathers, grandmothers, granddaughters, and so on. Many of these characters have secrets - some big, some small - that come to light along the way.....and some of them are very surprising.

The author artfully connects what, at first, seems to be a series of disparate events into a unified whole.....from which the murderer emerges.

I enjoyed the book and recommend it to fans of unusual mysteries.

In each Higashino Sgt. Kaga mystery I've read, he's done something quite unique, and in Newcomer, he surprised me again with his unusual approach to the mystery of a strangled woman.  One of the conceits of the story is that Sgt. Kaga is new to the Nihonbashi district, which apparently resembles ""old"" Tokyo; as he goes into different shops and houses, the reader gets the feel for a distinct place and time. Much like Miss Marple going to visit Dottie Bantry for tea and stopping to talk with Bert the gardener on the way, this is as much a slice-of-life as it is mystery.

The book is broken up into a series of nine chapters, eight of them focused on a cluster of interviewees related by household or shop, such as 'The Girl at the Rice Cracker Shop,' 'The Apprentice at the Japanese Restaurant,' and 'The Daughter-in-Law of the China Shop."" The stores are quiet businesses, family-run, often with the family living in back or upstairs of the shops.

There's a cast of dramatic personae at the beginning, which was much appreciated by the end. There's a wide group of people involved, and it is interesting to see their reactions to the police investigation, wondering what is going on, and how their information will be used. It's also interesting as a reader to be playing detective and wondering where people are being inaccurate or fudging the truth. However, after the third chapter or so, it's clear that the author has something other than just slight-of-hand in mind. I won't spoil the approach he took, except to say that I especially appreciated it in context of a particularly brutal and anti-heroic time in literature.

If you are looking for something outside the normal noir or humorous mystery, perhaps something along the lines of a Japanese Miss Marple in modern-retro Japan, Lt. Kaga is the way to go.

It is the 8th in the series, but doesn’t matter if you start here as the main character, Sergeant Kyochiro Kaga, is new to the Tokyo police force.

His style is like that of Colombo - kind and a bit bumbling while interviewing the many suspects and coming back on numerous occasions to ask additional questions.

review_2583317837,Apoorva,"Mar 13, 2019","‘Newcomer’ revolves around the murder of a middle-aged woman living in Nihonbashi area of Tokyo. The newly arrived detective, Kyochiro Kaga, is assigned to the case. The detective soon discovers that there are many people all over the town who, in one way or another, are linked to the victim or the incident. So, he goes on interviewing the suspects to figure out their role in the murder mystery.

This is a traditional whodunnit thriller. There are a lot of characters involved and I’m glad there’s a list of cast given in the beginning, otherwise recalling the names would’ve been painful! This was more of a laid back, comfortable mystery as it’s mostly focused on the lives of the suspects than the actual murder. Kaga goes on to learn more about the murder but discovers harmless skeletons in their closet and helps them solves their problems.

“People who’ve been traumatized by a crime are victims, too. Finding ways to comfort them is also part of my job.”

I loved the sweet and quirky personality of Kaga and I had fun delving into the domestic mysteries of the people’s lives and how they were connected to the murder. The book wasn’t much suspenseful and I wasn’t blown away by the ending, but I enjoyed reading the story. It’s always entertaining to read the mystery unravel due to the detective’s sharp observational skills and power of deduction.

If you don’t mind a cozy mystery, then go for it!

review_2189151141,Supreeth,"Nov 06, 2018","I wonder if Keigo Higashino walks all over the Tokyo brooding about random people, fitting in six W's and police terms, alibis, motives, timelines and everything. I guess he has written it all, whodunits, howdunits, whydunits, whendunits, wheredunits, did-he-dun-its. Newcomer falls under typical whodunit. For a mystery book, keeping the reader actually giving a crap for the characters is more important than plot and suspense and all that. Newcomer does keep the reader guessing and anticipating, but it just lacks the essence of his previous books and fails to meet those standards he'd set. I've basically read all his translated works in English except Naoko and if I've to rank, this one would take the last place after the name of the game is kidnapping. Nevertheless, I'd rate it four stars. Not a single word is wasted, as always. Kaga series has ten books so far, but unfortunately only two of them have been translated, the other one from the series translated to English being Malice.
I got into reading books because of Higashino, DOSX was only the second book which I ever read and then I went on a Higashino marathon. So if I ever learn Japanese, I'll probably read all of his works even though cozy mysteries aren't my thing (I don't even dig Agatha Christie's books).
As of plot, the book starts with the murder of a widowed woman followed by a series of chapters of random people— neutral third person writing— which all makes sense at the end, concluding the book. The book has character list in the beginning, so I'm not whining about the confusion with Japanese names.",4,22 likes,5

Book : Well ( huffs in pride), you got that right! There is murder in me. And a long possible list of persons who have done the crime! You are in for a ride!

After reading,

Me: You are fine.

Me: Not really. I don't want to hurt your emotions. I would go for a 3 star.

Book: What? Only 3? Why?

Me: There, there. Don't get worked up. It is just that you are not what I expected. You have got a lot of family drama inside you. There is goodness in you. There is a crime, I concur. But you also concentrate on family relations and how good a person can be. There is just no dark psyche! And it is no thriller. It is a regular ""who done it mystery"". We are just piecing together the clues and finally arriving at the conclusion. Then there are the names of characters! I am finding it difficult just to keep their track! You lack the pull, buddy. But as I said, I enjoyed Kaga and his observational skills. The way he arrives at the conclusions is good. So, then again. It is me, not you. You were just not my type, I guess!

review_2511599901,Faith,"Dec 03, 2018","Detective Kaga is newly assigned to the Nihonbashi Precinct. His first case is investigating the strangulation of a 45 year old divorced woman. There was an ever-widening group of suspects and witnesses to question. So many that the author had to include a cast of characters at the beginning of the book. Kaga is kindly and unobtrusive, but also deceptively shrewd and perceptive. He’s sort of a cross between Colombo and Miss Marple. From the description of the book I wasn’t expecting a cosy mystery, but that’s what this book is. Kaga not only solves the murder but ferrets out all of the secrets of the suspects and tweets their lives, leaving everyone except the murderer in a better place. Cosy mysteries are not my favorite genre, but this one held my interest and I would read more by this author. This book is part of a series but works as a standalone.

It's amazing that this tale involved murder, betrayal, and so much of pain at so many levels, and yet succeded in oozing positive feelings at the conclusion of each chapter!
Higashino rules, but Giles Murray is THE man, who has succeeded in capturing every mood, vibe and twitch in this nuanced slow-burner.
If I seem incapable of providing a coherent, cogent, objective analysis of this novel which is purportedly a mueder mystery as well as a Police Procedural, then blame it on them. For me, this was life, through a glass darkly.

review_2787648089,Mobyskine,"Apr 17, 2019","Another Kyoichiro Kaga! I love Kaga that he was so mysterious, like what Koji commented about him-- ""He sort of popped up, asked a few questions, and then vanished in a puff of smoke."" Kaga's mind seems 'unsure' but full of curiosity as a detective, him being nice and proper, he knows certain things that you might can't identify, his eyes and that out of the box thinking (that left right people walking with/without jackets!), I adore Kaga so much (since Malice he was so good!).

“Aren’t you supposed to be investigating her murder, Detective?”
“Oh, I am investigating the murder; of course I am. But my job as a detective should go beyond that.""

Kaga did great in mending certain broken hearts and displeasure during the investigation. He helped Tamiko and Koki. He said the nicest thing to Naoya about his mom and wife relationship. He sat together drinking with Yoriko and Naohiro.

""People who’ve been traumatized by a crime are victims, too. Finding ways to comfort them is also part of my job.”

Another thing I perfectly love that as the story-telling separated to each person involved directly and indirectly (with the crime and suspect) at each different chapter, the narrative changed accordingly to that person's background-- their work and surrounding plus their daily encounters. I like how it shows not just about the investigation but the family stories and struggles, the life drama, relationship, secrets and a bit of humanity as well. I was mesmerized for few times it feels weird to mesmerizing over a crime investigation stuff but heck this was something honestly great to feel good about.

The development of the plot giving me fairly intense and suspense, not much of a thrill (which I actually expected it to be more) but enough to increase my curiosity at each chapter. Higashino was super great in describing the crime, the surrounding plus the whole related scene, suspects and witnesses (although it seems so secretive, semi-descriptive and not much spoiler on the real murderer), and furthermore how he created Kaga as one of the investigator in charge. It felt good to see it from scratch to the end-- gathering evidence, eliminating suspects, checking alibis, the deductions and questioning, all those puzzling guesses, unexpected motive to some incidents, even that box of sweet cakes that caught up into the scene and that spinning top! Love the last chapter, a point of view from the detective of homicide division himself (I don't really like Uesugi that much anyway). They wrapping up the case just fine and Kaga getting around just well as a newcomer at the new neighborhood. Great work, Detective Kaga!",5,11 likes,5

review_2703750568,Saimon (ZanyAnomaly),"Feb 20, 2019","Newcomer felt more like a short story book of small-town family drama rather than the advertised book of murder, mystery, and intrigue. Here’s why I felt so:

While this book does start with a dead woman, I barely felt any emotion in the story because we never actually get talking to the people closest to the victim until the last 30% of the book. The first 200 pages were spent with the detective running around the neighborhood solving petty family drama issues mostly irrelevant to the murder. I just could not get into the atmosphere of the book because I simply could not care less about any of the “shocking” reveals at the end of each chapter.
- Why were someone’s mother and wife fighting and how were they planning to resolve it?
- Why was there wasabi in a sweet that shouldn’t contain wasabi?
- Why was the dog confused between taking two routes on its walk?
I simply do not care!
You can literally tear out the first 200 pages of the book and go into it knowing that a woman is dead AND THE PLOT WILL STILL MAKE SENSE! So, I – PERSONALLY, did not get the appeal of this chapter-wise drama-solving in the homes of people vaguely connected to the victim.
But the detective does explain why he does so in a later part of the book:
“I am investigating the murder, of course I am. But my job as a detective should go beyond that. People who’ve been traumatized by a crime are victims, too. Finding ways to comfort them is also part of my job.”
And that is a sweet sentiment, truly. But a detective simply cannot go around mentioning confidential information in an ongoing investigation just in hopes of soothing the unrest felt by other people – like the victim’s friend’s boyfriend (who barely knew her yet, for some reason, wanted to AVENGE her death by finding and killing the murderer.)

Higashino writes a well-rounded story that ties up all loose ends by the time we reach the last page of the book. And it makes for a nice reading on a Sunday morning - if you’re NOT looking to read a murder mystery.

PS – I suspect a lot of the essence of the novel was lost in translation, so I suggest reading it in Japanese if you could. At some points, the English was really bad, I felt like a big author such as Higashino would’ve requested for a better translator.

review_2518042923,Jessica Woodbury,"Sep 08, 2018","If you enjoy intricate and puzzling procedurals, hopefully you've already found Keigo Higashino. If you haven't, you're in luck. This newest translated book brings back Detective Kaga, who appeared in MALICE, for the most delightful of his novels to come to the US so far.

The joys of reading Higashino are the joys of how he leans into the details of a good investigation and how he plays with those forms. The actual crime here isn't as intricate as SALVATION OF A SAINT (which was a true joy of reveling in every tiny little detail and clue) but the structure of the book is the most interesting so far. The book doesn't follow Kaga or any person close to the investigation. It doesn't really follow a linear structure at all. Instead it presents a series of vignettes, small miniature investigations within the larger investigation. We do not even know any real personal information about the victim or who the suspects may be, the kind of information you'd normally get right off the bat, until more than halfway through the book. Instead we start with these tiny little tangents and slowly move closer and closer to the center.

In a normal structure you'd be asking, ""But why is the presence of this one rice cake relevant to a murder?"" Here you don't ever ask that question because you don't even know what the real investigation is actually about. You don't even know there IS a rice cake until you're well into the chapter. By then you've been pulled into the specific story of the shop where the chapter takes place, learning about the people who live there and the neighborhood it's in. Each section is its own little contained story of sorts, the kind of character who would say two sentences at the beginning of a Law & Order episode gets their own narrative, giving the book an episodic feel. To me, it didn't break things up, it just meant that each new chapter started a new world to discover.

This approach lets you enjoy much of the novel for what it is, lets you enjoy the way Kaga presents himself, the eccentricities of him, the way he interacts with people, and the methods he uses to move closer to the truth. Sometimes I get so caught up in what the end of a mystery is that I speed through it too quickly to enjoy it. Here you get to sit back and enjoy the ride. Even when you have most of the real details, even when you have a suspicion of who the killer may be (and you'll be right), the book has already taught you how to read it and you know that what really matters is the journey and not the destination.

I was a little skeptical after the last Higashino that was released in the US, UNDER THE MIDNIGHT SUN, which broke out of the tight yet elaborate mysteries into a bigger, longer thing. I wasn't as excited about it, I feel like it's that intricacy and detail where Higashino shines most. I enjoyed this one so much that I'm hoping the next book is another Kaga mystery, even though I've enjoyed the Detective Galileo series very much.",4,9 likes,5
review_4176609673,Dilushani Jayalath,"Aug 17, 2021","Being my first Higashino book I really did not know what to expect but I can say I was caught off-guard. As any Asian reader I’ve heard plenty of Higashino and not too surprisingly, I’ve caught my fair share of Galileo too. Despite that this was my first time reading any of his books. On the top of my head I could say that this is a unique book. It is nothing like your typical crime mystery novel and for some it might take some time getting used to. The whole story is written in a non-linear manner and the way it’s chronicled it may take some getting used to. Rather than just a crime novel a little dose of sentiment was added to it too. This could be said to be somewhat parallel to Asian crime shows/novels that were more popular in the last decade although contemporary ones take a more practical and harsh turn.
As many have been mentioning this brings back the nostalgic old school detective work back and not in a bad way either. I can say I did enjoy the story despite not being left wowed. The whole experience was without doubt a unique one and one I might like to go through once again. Until I manage to unearth another Higashino book accidentally, kudos.",3,10 likes,5
review_4178874815,Lata,"Nov 21, 2021","This is very different from other detective mysteries, even the ones written by Keigo Higashino. It doesn’t start with describing the murder and evidences. The victim's identity, the circumstances in which the victim was found and the clues are reconstructed through the witness interviews, and each suspect is eliminated one by one. Since the reader has nothing to go by, we are deprived the pleasure of vicarious sleuthing.
I didn't like this structure of story telling.
I don't know if all the Japanese policemen are as polite as Inspector Kaga. He brings sweets and goodies to the witness and apologizes for questioning them ! He also seemed to have too much time in hand, not only to solve the murder but to get involved with each witness and sort out their inter-personal relationships.

This is not Higashino's best, but I do look forward to reading his other books. Though he has written many books in Japanese, the translated books are not coming fast enough for his English readers.",3,8 likes,5
review_3487102053,Lauren,"Jan 05, 2021","NEWCOMER by Keigo Higashino, translated from the Japanese by Giles Murray, 2009

My first completed book of 2021 and #JanuaryinJapan

I haven't read a detective/crime mystery in some time, but have often enjoyed the genre in the past - I devoured them in my teens!. There is a vibrant Japanese crime / mystery writing community, and many of these books are reaching an international audience through translation, so I was happy to jump on board and check it out.

Thanks to Laura @affiknittyreads who read and recommended this one in January 2020. Your words about it led me to pick it up!

NEWCOMER takes a different approach to the traditional murder mystery, a broad view of the neighborhood and all the characters involved but also with many rewarding tangents that give a slice of life to the modern Tokyo setting.

The title refers both to the unfortunate murder victim, a newcomer to her neighborhood, as well as the detective, Kyoichiro Kaga, who has just moved to this new police precinct. In solving this crime, he also portrays the bustling life, dramas, and undercurrents in Tokyo’s Nihonbashi district - we get to meet his new neighbors right along with him.

It was the small mysteries, the little stories that swirled around the main story, that really intrigued me. These small tales are nested within the whole. The estranged son and his father, the family that owns a rice cracker shop and their customers, the people who meet walking their dogs at the neighborhood shrines.

I learned that this book is actually the second of the Detective Kaga series, but I don't think that one needs to necessarily follow the chronology to understand and enjoy the stories. Higashino's storytelling is intriguing, and I would like to check out others in this series.

review_2618290067,Marie-Therese,"Dec 10, 2018","2.5 stars maybe.

This was a rather disappointing mystery. Not only did it take a very long time to get going (the pacing felt off until about 40% in and the language in the first half was exceedingly plodding and awkward, as if either Higashino or the translator just could not figure out what tone to take to get this exposition out of the way) but, when it finally did, the mystery itself was all too easy to figure out (even the final ""twist"" signaled obviously well before the end) and there was little emotional payback or intellectual satisfaction to the solution of the puzzle.

Where the book does succeed (really the only thing that makes it worth reading) is in the depiction of a small, traditional Japanese shopping district and the close relationships among the vendors in business and residence there. Both Detective Kaga and the murder victim are ""newcomers"" to the district and exploring the area through their experiences is interesting, educational, sometimes even touching. Kaga displays his usual remarkable powers of deduction but also a very well developed sense of empathy and his dedication to offering the living victims of the murder some comfort is refreshing. The various small mysteries related to the victim's relationships with others in the district are actually far more satisfying than the main crime and, had Higashino shaped and trimmed the book more thoughtfully, they could have carried the story to a higher level.

Recommended only for serious Higashino fans or readers interested in the minutiae of Japanese social culture.",3,8 likes,5
review_3341348781,Divine,"May 18, 2020","While Malice is deemed to be the better installment of the series, I fairly think that Newcomer makes Detective Kaga's involvement more pronounced and hmmmm likeable? This was unexpectedly well fleshed out and pretty wholesome for crime fiction. One of the most commendable aspects here is how the setting was laid out and held significance in the storyline. It makes the reading experience more like a field trip to Japan as it details the circuits of Ningyocho or commonly known as the Doll Town.

The chapters were broken down into condensed storylines that may or may not have an effect on the murder case happening. What's more is that every chapter is laid out on the background of each specialty store found in Ningyocho. From rice cracker shops, bean pastry cafes, restaurants, clockwork stores, to antique shops, it's an amazing sight to see especially that it is brimming with the culture of the Edo Period in Japan. It's so refreshing to read as it gives us a glimpse of Japan's past and you'll definitely see how the people value their heritage in these place.

On top of that, each chapter was episodic in a sense that made it easier to read and presents you with one mystery to another that is solved by Detective Kaga. Some of the chapters don't necessarily connect with the murder case but each has its own charm and values to empart! Alongside this, this kind of structure gives a center stage for Kaga's deduction skills to be seen in action.

Like I said before, Keigo Higashino's books often has themes of filial love and Newcomer heavily draws on this as well. I really love this type of storytelling and I find this more to my taste compared to Malice, which is deemed to be the ""better"" installment in the Kyoichiro Kaga series.

review_2495546243,carol.,"Jan 31, 2019","Higashino is a best-selling, award-winning, and prolific mystery author in Japan, but only six of his works have been translated into English. They've been extremely interesting reads because--as least for the ones I've read--he rarely takes the traditional mystery approach. In The Devotion of Suspect X, for instance, the reader witnesses the who, what where and how of the death within the first few pages, but ends up following along with the detective as the witnesses conceal evidence. In Salvation of the Saint, the who seems obvious, perhaps, but the how is deeply puzzling. Malice uses an artifice of dual story-telling from pre-murder to resolution, alternating between the first-person narrative of a man who was friends with the murder victim, and the detective assigned to the case. Interestingly, though the who and the how seems to become clear about three-quarters in, Higashino still has a few tricks up his sleeve.

The writing felt particularly simple, at least the sections belonging to the witness and friend to the victim, Osamu Nonoguchi. When the story switched to that of Detective Kaga, the sophistication improved and became more consistent with what I remembered from earlier books. I suppose the change in style emphasized the different voices, and as Osamu writes children's books, is perhaps supposed to represent a more straightforward style. I found I much preferred Kaga's voice. I wondered early on if we were dealing with an unreliable narrator--and those who read my reviews know that if I'm figuring things out early, it must not be particularly subtly done--which is really one of my least favorite devices. But even Christie used the device, so I soldiered on in good faith.

As an aside, both the murdered man and Nonoguchi are writers, so there are a number of bits and insights into writing and the pressures of publishing. I wondered if Higashino was inserting his own experiences, much like Christie did with Adrienne Oliver. Interesting insights, although I'm not sure where it falls into the timing of Higashino's works, which were turned into tv/movies and were prize-winning in Japan.

The other interesting aspect to Higashino's mysteries is that they are very much about the emotion of the crime, which I've only gradually realized as being radically different from my normal private-eye American mysteries. He usually does not follow the classic pattern of announcing the murderer at the end of the book; instead, the ending is more about wrapping up the emotional fallout, or about an explanation of the crime that includes the history of how the murderer arrived at their crime.

In this respect, Malice was somewhat unsatisfying. Originally published in 1996, I couldn't help but think that I was facing a large cultural and temporal divide. Though there are a couple of themes that continue to resonate--mild subject spoilers (view spoiler)--in this case, the emotion of the mystery fell flat. The details of the crime were impeccable, and the cat-and-mouse byplay intriguing. As a crime, it all made sense, but the motive... didn't. I appreciated the 'twist,' and I could see how could develop, but in this case, the emotion of the crime failed to transcend the gap. 

On the enjoyment scale, two-and-a-half cherry blossoms, rounding up due to his other works.",3,98 likes,6

But here's the thing with Keigo Higashino's Malice: the first sentence of the publisher's blurb reads: “Acclaimed bestselling novelist Kunihiko Hidaka is found brutally murdered in his home on the night before he was to leave Japan and relocate to Vancouver.” Ah, thinks I, a bestselling novelist is the victim of a brutal murder, this mystery surely incorporates much about novels, authorship, publishing, reading and writing – for me, topics holding special appeal.

After both reading the book and listening to the audio book, I'm here to report I wasn't disappointed; if anything, my expectations were exceeded – this mystery novel features the many facets of what it can mean to be a bestselling author.

And once I started reading, I was completely and totally hooked. Keigo Higashino does a masterful job of handling all the elements critical for a good whodunnit – atmosphere, setting, crime, sleuth, villain, narrative momentum, foreshadowing, red herrings, satisfying ending.

Additionally, a special call-out for the way Mr. Higashino develops his characters and varies the novel's rhythm by rotating first-person narrators, the inclusion of backstory and, most especially, the author's impeccable timing.

For added spice, bestselling novelist Kunihiko Hidaka isn't the only writer gracing the pages of Malice. There's also Hidaka's best friend, Osamu Nonoguchi, published author of children's books and an aspiring novelist himself, a man who just so happened to be a teacher some years back at the same school where Kyoichiro Kaga, the detective assigned the murder case, was also a teacher.

No more from me since the layers of mystery begin right in the first chapter. Every reader deserves to be introduced to the details of the case, fresh, free from anything remotely suggesting a spoiler. However, before calling it quits, one more tidbit: we find out on the first pages someone poisoned a next door neighbor's cat, a beautiful cat like the one pictured above. How dreadful!

If you're after a good mystery where authorship and bestselling novels play a central role, Malice is your book.

----Heather Brewer


Keigo Higashino, the most popular and biggest selling Japanese fiction author, has penned an intriguing thriller, Malice that is the fourth book in the detective Kyoichiro Kaga series. This book revolves around the murder of a bestselling author right before he was going to leave Japan with his new wife to Canada and also right before the publication of his another book. The infamous detective soon arrives in the crime scene, and within few days he suspects the best friend of the author to be the killer behind the author's death.


Synopsis:

Acclaimed bestselling novelist Kunihiko Hidaka is found brutally murdered in his home on the night before he's planning to leave Japan and relocate to Vancouver. His body is found in his office, a locked room, within his locked house, by his wife and his best friend, both of whom have rock solid alibis. Or so it seems.

At the crime scene, Police Detective Kyochiro Kaga recognizes Hidaka's best friend, Osamu Nonoguchi. Years ago when they were both teachers, they were colleagues at the same public school. Kaga went on to join the police force while Nonoguchi eventually left to become a full-time writer, though with not nearly the success of his friend Hidaka.

As Kaga investigates, he eventually uncovers evidence that indicates that the two writers' relationship was very different that they claimed, that they were anything but best friends. But the question before Kaga isn't necessarily who, or how, but why. In a brilliantly realized tale of cat and mouse, the detective and the killer battle over the truth of the past and how events that led to the murder really unfolded. And if Kaga isn't able to uncover and prove why the murder was committed, then the truth may never come out.


Police Detective Kyochiro Kaga is assigned on the murder case of the popular Japanese fiction author, Kunihiko Hidaka. On the crime scene, he is surprised to find his old college-cum-teaching-mate, Osamu Nonoguchi, who claims that he is the best friend of the deceased author and have found himself in the crime scene along with the author's new wife. Kaga's quest and later investigation soon places Nonoguchi as the prime suspect, but going back into the past of the two friends reveals a different relationship between the two authors than Nonoguchi claims to be. But why did the prime suspect kill an innocent author? Can Kaga reveal the truth?

Well this is the first time that I ever read any book by Higashino, and I've only heard good things about him and his books. But very unfortunate to say that I found his book very dull, monotonous and predictable. Crime fiction being my favorite genre, I take the books of this genre pretty seriously, and I was very much surprised after the end of the book that this one turned out to be so much disappointing, where a regular reader like me could easily guess out the whodunit and the reason behind it, but the author has tried to twist the reason so much, that in the end I felt confused.

The author's writing is really emphatic, yet it has too much depth, maybe over depth that mars the overall charm and intrigue of the story. Being a thriller/crime fiction, tension should have been a key ingredient of this book, but there was neither any tension, nor any major twist that will leave the readers in awe. The narrative of the book not only reflects the local Japanese dialect with its proper translation into English, but the author has managed to make it quite arresting, yet if the plot lacks from any suspense, then even if the narrative is engaging, the readers won't manage to find any interest. The pacing is very, very slow, I do not know, how I finished reading despite of the constant torture.

The mystery lacked depth and closure, mid way through the book, I expected that the killer would be someone else, as the detective kept going back to the core of the two characters, and coming back with failed results. The mystery could have been much more well-developed with fast pace and more unexpected twists and turns.

The characters are honestly way too boring and lacked dimension or layers to view them as otherwise. Besides the main character, Kaga, the rest of the characters could not leave an impression in the minds of the readers. Kaga is an exceptional and smart-witted hero and he is the one factor that makes the story so compelling to read. His notes and his mindset works so intelligently yet his demeanor reflects of no such brilliance, he projects as someone simple yet clever.

In a nutshell, this is the last time that I bought any book by this author and I would suggest the hardcore crime fiction fans to skip this book, otherwise, if you're looking for a light thriller, then go for this one.

Verdict: A boring and a predictable thriller!",3,27 likes,6
review_3906176996,K.J. Charles,"Mar 23, 2021","I have become addicted to these Japanese murder mysteries that manage to be hugely satisfying and not annoyingly meta while playing with the form of the genre. In this one we very rapidly learn who did it, and how isn't hard, so the main preoccupation is why, and the answer is of course twisty.

This one is about a murdered writer and there is one of the most jawdropping observations on writing craft I have ever seen (jawdropping because only when it's made do we see how it's worked) which I am going to think about forever. Actually, two now I think of it. Whoa this is clever.",0,55 likes,6
review_1202347422,Carol,"Feb 16, 2015","Malice is a standalone Higashino novel, at least in terms of what's available in English in the US market at this time. It's a puzzle-solving police procedural, that may turn on true love, infidelity, a cover-up of a past crime, jealousy of professional success, bribery, middle-school bullying. From early on, the question isn't, who? or how? (We know both of those answers almost immediately) it's why? It's not a thriller. There's no racing against a clock. Unlike in American and British police procedurals, the investigator, Detective Kaga, appears to have all the time he desires to investigate the motive behind Nonoguchi's murder of Hidaka, a successful author. Nonoguchi isn't likely to skip town. Kaga's supervisor tweaks him gently once over his efforts to understand Nonoguchi’s motive, but he neither reassigns him nor directs him to stop. Note to self, impatient American mystery reader: ""Toto, we aren't in Kansas any more.""

We have two narrators, one of whom is unreliable and the other the reader believes to be reliable. Malice switches back and forth from one to another, and also includes a section of a dozen or so 3/4 page interviews with a variety of persons who knew the victim and the murderer back in middle school. Each has a distinct voice and perspective, which few authors beside Higashino could pull off.

There's also an element of inside-baseball for writers. One of the core possible explanations for Nonoguchi's motive for murdering Hidaka - one that receives an inordinate amount of Malice's page-count -- is that Hidaka may have taken several completed novel manuscripts penned by Nonoguchi, and used them as the basis for several of his award-winning, NYT bestselling books. If the term, ""plagiarism"" makes your blood boil, you know who you are, and Malice is the book for you.

On the other hand, I didn't give Malice 4 or 5 stars because it has, to my mind, a glaring flaw. Higashino makes both the victim and the murderer unappealing from the beginning of his novel, and Detective Kaga is a blank slate. That choice is fundamental to his ultimate solution, e.g., the public and the reader (and perhaps even the police) must despise Hidaka and feel nothing or negative emotions for Nonoguchii. When I have time to read, I implicitly make a choice of which world I want at that moment to inhabit, including which characters I want either to know better or to spend time with. With Malice, because of the author's choice, that choice could easily have led to a DNF, had I not been committed to finishing it based on past, good reading experiences with Higashino's works. I made myself keep reading and finish this book, as if finishing it was on my task list, not because I wanted to read it. Higashino didn't make me care ""why""? In The Devotion of Suspect X and Salvation of a Saint, the victim was equally unappealing, but either the murderer or the investigator was interesting, or likeable, or fascinating. Not here. Kaga was a polite, smart blank slate. No one was interesting. Plus, there was a dangling fact that never mattered and wasn't a herring of any shade.",3,,6
review_2341525841,Bharath,"Apr 01, 2018","This is the second book of Keigo Higashino that I read after “The Devotion of Suspect X”. This is an excellent murder mystery as well. The style is similar – great story & plot, depth of characters and systematic & painstaking analysis. It does not have the frills which build suspense and many readers have become so used to – the end of a chapter having a sentence or two with a touch of drama. In many ways, this is the way murder mysteries should be written.

Hidaka is a best selling novelist, and Nonoguchi is his friend – he writes children’s books too. Hidaka lost his wife some time back and is now newly married again. He is found murdered at his home by his friend and wife. Detective Kaga is given the case (he and Nonoguchi were colleagues as teachers at a school a few years back), and quickly uncovers a number of clues not quite apparent when one looks at the circumstances and situation of the case.

There seem to be a number of complexities, all of which need investigation well into the past – the relation between Hidaka and Nonoguchi, Hidaka’s relation with his first wife and also a number of incidents from the past.

After reading around 1/3rd of the book, it appeared as if the mystery was over. I wondered what more could come now, and was worried that the story would just drag on. As it turns out, there was a lot more to come – all from very painstaking investigation by Detective Kaga. An in depth investigation of motive leads Detective Kaga well into the past and interviews with various different people to uncover the full sequence of events.

This is an excellent murder mystery – and recommended without hesitation if you like this genre!",4,,6
review_1054039406,Diane S ☔,"Sep 13, 2014","I find myself quite taken with Japanese mysteries. Not a word is wasted, not much descriptive language, but they are such puzzles. Like the puzzle boxes, where one must solve one part and then finds there is more to solve. So many times in this story I thought it was figured out only to quickly discover that everything first thought was totally wrong. Divided into individual parts between two characters, each part brought a new perspective and further evidence. A murder, but not graphic at all, and much psychological meanderings.

review_2526776010,Apoorva,"Dec 20, 2018","‘Malice’ revolves around the death of a famous author Kunihiko Hidaka who was going to move to Canada with his wife the next day and was working on a novel in his locked house. His body is discovered by Osamu Nonoguchi, a best friend of Hidaka who’s also an author of children’s books.

The investigation team involves Detective Kyoichiro Kaga who was a colleague of Osamu in the past when they were both working as teachers but eventually they went their separate ways. Kaga suspects him and digs into the past of both writers to find the reason for any malice between them.

First off, the book is written brilliantly. I can’t say it was as good as his previous works but I appreciate the complexity and the attention-grabbing mystery and the awesome twists. We learn the story in the first person with the help of shifting narratives between Osamu and Kaga taking us all the way into the past.

The book does not spend a lot of time developing the main characters like Kaga and Osamu. So, it felt a little dull in my opinion, at least in the beginning. Mostly, it might be because the narration is unreliable and the beginning is predictable and not suspenseful enough. In spite of that, the story was engaging.

The identity of the murderer is revealed at the start of the novel but what’s different about this story is that the heart of the mystery revolves around the motivation of the crime rather than how it was committed. This led me to encounter a lot of red herrings on the way and I was absolutely amazed.

About more than halfway around the book, I felt like everything seems to have resolved and what the hell am I going come across next that would dazzle me? I was wrong! The story just takes an exciting turn and we learn a different side of the story. I did not like the ending much. But it was a pretty enjoyable book.

review_1106783876,Miles,"Nov 15, 2014","Malice by Japanese author Keigo Higashino represents not only the first book that I’ve read by the author but also just happens to be one of my favourite books of the year. It’s an evocative read that puts the reader at ease from the opening pages until its dénouement where everything is tied up in a neat, unexpected and satisfying package.

Wonderfully translated from Japanese by Alexander O Smith and Elye Alexander the book is an effortless read. It’s as if the author sat down to write and in an hour had finished one of the most captivating reads I’ve had the pleasure of reading this year. It’s such a comfortable read that I found it hard to imagine that this wasn’t originally written in English!

As you delve into the story you begin to take things at face value and then, slowly but surely, Keigo Higashino moves the goalposts and takes you, the reader, on a different path and you begin to question everything you thought was true in the beginning. The pace is spot on and as comfort begins to set in, the author starts to unravel the mysteries surrounding the crimes both in present and in the past.

The story is narrated by Osamu Nonoguchi, friend of the deceased and fellow author and a detective and former teacher Kyochiro Kyaga, two very different approaches but both allowing the story to unfold and develop in their own unique way. I enjoyed both viewpoints but found Kaga’s reasoning and deductive skills superior to that of Nonoguchi’s storytelling. There was just something about Kaga that I found compelling but the way he discovered the hidden secrets and his dogged determination in solving the mystery was nothing short of superb.

If you are looking for crime fiction that is slightly unusual with wonderful storytelling, engaging characters and a simple crime that is anything but, then Malice is without question a must read. A game of cat and mouse from beginning to end, the book satisfies on multiple levels.",4,16 likes,6

review_1053305543,Maxine (Booklover Catlady),"Sep 12, 2014","I found Malice to be an okay read, but a bit ho-hum for me, perhaps being a fan of very fast paced and often dark crime books this one was a bit too slow for me, indeed very well written and I got the whole concept of the killer being identified early then the book focusing on the WHY rather than the WHO, but it just was not something I got very excited about.

Acclaimed bestselling novelist Kunihiko Hidaka is brutally murdered in his home on the night before he's planning to leave Japan and relocate to Vancouver. His body is found in his office, in a locked room, within his locked house, by his wife and his best friend, both of whom have rock solid alibis. Or so it seems.

Police Detective Kyochiro Kaga recognizes Hidaka's best friend from years ago when they were both teachers. Kaga went on to join the police force while Nonoguchi became a full-time writer, though with not nearly the success of his friend Hidaka. When Kaga suspects something is a little bit off with Nonoguchi's statement, he investigates further, ultimately executing a search warrant on Nonoguchi's apartment. There he finds evidence that shows that the two writers' relationship was very different than they claimed...

So the book takes a different approach to most crime novels, where the focus is on the WHO in a murder investigation. Detective Kaga is pretty certain early on he has his man, the book then goes into exploring the complexities behind the WHY and delving into the real relationship suspect Nonoguchi had with the now murdered author, and his once best friend Hidaka.

There is an strong spotlight and focus on the characters and I did really like Detective Kaga's character in this novel. He's very likeable and clever.

I found it very slow in a lot of places, and a bit boring if I am really honest. It just didn't have the excitement factor or anything to make it particularly spectacular. Yet many have really loved this book, so I won't say much more, try it for yourself if you fancy it. It's not an awful book, just not memorable enough for me to rave about.

review_1093763478,Nimish Sawant,"Oct 31, 2014","Keigo Higashino's first book that I read - The Devotion of Suspect X - was the first instance of buying a book online, purely on impulse. And what a decision that was. Within 2 days flat, I finished it and was completely awed. I started searching more books by him, but sadly there were no new translations out. Couple of months back I read my second Higashino book - The Salvation of a Saint. This wasn't quite as good as The Devotion of Suspect X, at least for me. But I know for a fact that it wont stop me from reading more of his stuff.

So last Monday when I came across Malice accidentally while checking out Amazon for my monthly fix - more books, I just hit Buy when I saw the name of the author.

Malice, like his other two books that I have read, starts off with a murder in the first chapter itself. That is the beauty of Higashino detective stories I believe. It is not a traditional whodunnit. So if you are expecting that, read other authors.

To give the gist of the story: Kunihiko Hidaka is a best selling author, a widower who has recently remarried, is about to shift to Canada with his new wife Rie. His friend Osamu Nonoguchi, a struggling children's author, visits Hidaka to say goodbye. Hidaka has decided to stay back in the house as he has to submit a serialised story to the editor of a magazine. His wife is supposed to head to a hotel for the night. Hidaka gets a visitor who wants to discuss something with him. Nonoguchi excuses himself and heads home. Later that same night Hidaka is found murdered at his apartment.

I know that is not a very coherent gist, but just a short summary of the first chapter. The only other thing I would like to add is the fact that the case is being investigated by Detective Kaga, a former teacher-turned-cop who was Nonoguchi's colleague in a school they both taught at. Saying anything more would be blasphemy!

The beauty of the novel lies in the rest of the chapters. In a couple of more chapters, the actual murderer surrenders as well. Halfway through the book you even have a coherent confession by the murderer. I won't say anymore of the plot.

Like I said before, this is not a traditional murder mystery or detective novel. Complexity of the characters, a purely psychological cat and mouse game between the detective and the murderer, delicate layering of the story are some of the hallmarks of Higashino novels. The way he has used multiple characters to give a first person account in some chapters adds a nice dimension to the flow of the narrative. Higashino even pays homage to Akira Kurosawa, with an entire chapter having a Rashomon-like same-story-multiple-angles approach.

The translation by Alexander O Smith, is great and you will rarely feel like putting the book down. I would not call it a pacy read, like say a James Patterson book. You have to be patient as the layers of the story unfold and the complexities of the characters come to the fore. I like the way the police procedures are explained. YOu really can't anticipate what will follow in the chapters.

Just like The Devotion of Suspect X had an unforgettable climax, the last chapter of Malice will stay with you long after you have finished the book. And it is not a very thick book either.

It is just a pity that there aren't translations of his other works easily available here. But I will always be looking.

PS: This is something that really irritates me. Every physical book (I read the Kindle edition of Malice) of Keigo Higashino comes with a blurb - The Japanese Stieg Larsson. Keigo Higashino is NOT a Japanese Stieg Larsson. No offence to the Swedish author (I loved all his books), but it is quite a disrespectful blurb to use, to sell the book.",5,15 likes,6
review_1058324306,Susan,"Sep 18, 2014","Keigo Higashino is the author of the incredibly successful “The Devotion of Suspect X” and, the slightly less so, “Salvation of a Saint.” I have never read anything by this author before, so was curious to try this newly translated work. It is less of a whodunit and more of a ‘why’ and a ‘how’ the crime was carried out and what motivated it.

Kunihiko Hidaka is a bestselling author. Widowed, he has recently remarried the much younger Rie, and the couple are moving to Canada. When his friend, Osamu Nonoguchi, visits, the house is packed up and Rie is heading to a hotel for the night, but Hidaka is staying behind to complete and article, as he has a deadline. Hidaka and Nonoguchi chat when suddenly a woman arrives; the sister of a man that both friends went to High School with and who is complaining about a novel written by Hidaka, which she claims is based on her brother’s character. Nonoguchi heads home and, later that same evening, finds Hidaka murdered in his office.

What follows is very much a cat and mouse game between Detective Kaga, who is investigating the murder and Hidaka’s friend, Nonoguchi. I found that, although this novel did not follow the normal route of discovering the killer, the twists and turns of the plot were quite captivating enough to keep me interested. Kaga used to be a schoolteacher and, indeed, worked with Nonoguchi. The shared past of so many of the characters, the false trails and the motivations for the crime are gradually unveiled. This is an unusual and interesting read and I look forward to going back and reading Keigo Higashino’s earlier novels.

★★★★½

Keigo Higashino’s approach towards crime thrillers is totally different. The first book I read by him was 'Devotion of Suspect X’ i remember enjoying that book but not as much as I enjoyed Malice. I am totally in awe of this one. The story, the way it was presented to us readers and the characterisation everything was just incredible.

At first, the story seemed very simple and to the point,
Firstly, we witness the crime,
Secondly, we get to know who has committed it and
Thirdly, the person who committed the crime also accepts that he is guilty of doing it.
This whole thing happens in just about 80 pages. So I kept thinking about what's left? That's, when Detective Kaga starts his research for the reason behind this crime and whatever reason the guilty was providing, was it genuine or just an illusion? And that's how the story moves on in search of the actual reason. Here we not only get to the bottom of the crime but also it makes us wonder about how the criminal mind works and how it is rooted which is scarier than the crime itself come to think of it.
Although I don’t read many crime thrillers if at all I want to read one and enjoy it at the same time then it should be like Malice.

We quickly learn how the central murder was committed and who did it. But Detective Kaga can't let the case go until he understands why the victim had to die. In this well-crafted story, discovering the truth is a process akin to peeling away the layers of an onion. Along the way Higashino pulls in reflections on being a teacher, being an author, and being a victim of bullying.

At times the story takes on a confessional tone that was, to me, oddly reminiscent of some of Poe's narrators' quietly unnerving disclosures. Of course, having just re-read a couple of Poe stories, I may be finding something more here than actually exists. But still, there was a quality in the shifting first person points of view that felt Poe-ish. Certainly the sense of Malice that pervades the story is something Poe would find familiar.

I really need to create a GR shelf to house books that tempt me to describe them as ""nifty"". This book would fit there. Simultaneously clever and uncomplicated, and well worth a quick read.",4,15 likes,6

This was the third, and till now the last work of Higashino that I had read. The first two were part of The Detective Galileo series, and this one, I read it as a standalone. That sort of made me less expectant, though now I know that Kyoichiro Kaga features in quite some other tales. Definitely, someday, once again…

Well, this one is also not the usual “whodunnit”, but rather a “whydunit”. The tale begins with an acclaimed bestselling author Kunihiko Hidaka who was found murdered in his home in Japan the night before he was moving to Vancouver. And his “best-friend”, who discovered the corpse along with the deceased’s wife, turned out to be Kaga’s ex-colleague. Osama Nonoguchi and Kaga both were school teachers, before the former became an author and the latter joined the force. The narrator of the tale is also Nonoguchi, who soon admits of an infatuation to his late “friend”, Hidaka’s wife. And hereby we can feel again a touch of Agatha Christie. Not that it plays any disappointment or spoils anything. Just makes the tale frighteningly great.

“Everyone has secrets. And everyone has the right to keep them. Even if they’re dead.”

For parts, the author entrusts upon Kaga to narrate the tale. And we soon delve into the past, for it, even here feeds us of many shocking facts. It really did pay off to me, that I chose to read it last due to the title. And the best thing is that the work does feel like a master’s homage to the classic tales from this genre, as, it rarely employs technology, or anything modern in detection (as so many modern crime thrillers do, so much so it feels quite effortless work; however Higashino deviated this even in his few other works).

You will foresee the culprit from quite some time before the ending. but that doesn’t make it any less complex of a tale. Not a single twist does feel thrusted upon, and quite indirectly makes some deep inquiry on the psychological devil of a man. And the social messages: I do feel that’s an admirable speciality of Higashino. It does make a very scary read, more than I would’ve asked for, actually. You know those stories after which you start questioning reality, and how much a man can sink actually? Well…this is one of them.

I hadn’t read anything by Higashino after this… and don’t know if I will for sure. He had really set such a high bar of expectation for me. I don’t want to be let down, like I had been for Harry Potter and The Cursed Child. But these all were great, especially this one. I do feel this one underrated.

I had no idea what to expect from this. I totally picked it for the cover - look how pretty! Blood blossoms in springtime. Awwww!

Turns out, this is a good, old-fashioned-like crime-solving mystery, a la Sherlock Holmes or an Agatha Christie novel.
You see the parts, you follow the misleads or you don't, but it all dovetails nicely in the end and you get your resolution.
So was I surprised? No. I'd figured it out pretty quickly (I think that has a lot more to do with the reader than with my ability to solve mysteries), I just didn't understand the why. Actually, I'd come up with a different, slightly more sinister why, one that was related but more like the flip side of the coin.
Was I, therefore, bored?
Not in the least. It was comforting to watch everything unfold. I could be smug when I was correct (The cat! THE CAT!) in my assumptions but my eyebrows rose several times when I was proven wrong (The new wife! THE NEW WIFE!)
It's a tidy story, well-written and nicely-composed even with the translation which, I suspect, was heavily Americanized.

This just came out last year so I was wondering why it was placed in the mid- to late-90's. Turns out, that wasn't a device; this was originally published in 1996. It all makes sense now. Mystery solved.

So it's an enjoyable read for mystery-lovers who don't need deep, psychological twists, who don't need blood and gore and a dame who has a knife. On the surface, it's fairly light, despite there having been a murder.

Underneath, though, is a darker issue, something I think we tend to overlook, judging by our crime novels and television shows and blockbuster movies: (view spoiler)

The book is dialogue heavy and readers seeking thrills may not enjoy this book; however, I love a police officer unwilling to accept the surface truth. This is a showdown in which Kaga has the upper hand.",4,10 likes,6

Higashino is a master of misdirection-he will wrong-foot the reader with a deft turn of phrase. However, a trick repeated once too often becomes rather transparent, and IMO it happened here-by the last third of the book I could guess where the story was going.

Still, it is an ingenious mystery and terrifically structured, and a very fast read.",3,12 likes,6

review_2016653481,Vivian,"Jul 22, 2017","This was fun.

Hot shot ad man, Sakuma has a change of luck. This starts a whole new game he decides to play. Revenge is the game, and Sakuma is a dedicated player. There is a lovely analysis of masks and I suppose if I were a better reviewer I'd go through various Noh plays and pick out the times that Sakuma or other characters displayed classic postures of Noh masks. Maybe I'll do it, later.



Even though I saw substantial portions of this long before they happened, there was a twist I didn't add in and it was definitely entertaining. In end, I read it one day and enjoyed myself. I raced through the last fifty pages and the very last one was worth it. So, yeah, I really liked it and I'll be checking out another of Higashino's book.",4,21 likes,7

review_2780605698,Apoorva,"May 20, 2019","First of all, this book didn’t dazzle me as much as many of the author’s previous books, but I think it’s quite interesting to read. The protagonist Sakuma works at a PR firm. He treats everything like a game and he’s very good at winning. When his project idea gets dismissed for not being good enough, he feels slighted and decided to exact revenge.

What happens next is the game of kidnapping as you can guess from the title. The first half is slow and quite predictable. But, if you’ve read Higashino before, then you know you’re in for a surprise. I definitely enjoyed the last half of the book and the twist at the end. I loved the interaction between the characters and the discussion about masks. Give this book a try to you want to read something short and entertaining.",4,31 likes,7
review_1942005398,Arun Iyer,"Mar 31, 2017","I am little baffled on how to rate this book. On one hand, this little mystery story is one of the better ones in its genre and on the other hand, if one compares it to other books written by Keigo Higashino falls way behind. So, I begrudgingly rate this book at 3 stars.

This book is about a battle of wits between two very smart people and none come out better at the end (in my humble opinion). There is nothing more to say about the story beyond this except that the reader is witness to a kidnapping and then the surprise ending. Anything more would be just spoilers.

Having said that, this book brings to question several things about morality. Be it the sensibility that allows certain people to treat a serious crime as a game or the vanity of the rich who think they are above the law. At the end, I ended up hating every character in the story.

Overall, I found this book - a breeze to read, quite entertaining and by the end, a little depressing.",3,13 likes,7

This one's very clever though depends rather too much on two entirely chance acts, one at the beginning and one at the end, which slightly took away from the cleverness.

review_2564664349,nananatte,"Oct 16, 2018","เพื่อนพูดถึงเรื่อง ""โหงวเฮ้ง"" หลังอ่านเรื่องนี้จบ ไอ้เราก็อ่านมานานมากแล้ว จำไม่ได้เลยว่ามีนิยายคุณเคโงะพูดถึง ""โหงวเฮ้ง"" ด้วยเหรอ?

หยิบมาอ่านรอบนี้ ชอบกว่ารอบแรกนะ คงเพราะรู้ตอนจบแล้ว พอพลิกกลับมาอ่าน เลยเข้าใจพฤติกรรมตัวละครได้ดีขึ้นค่ะ

""เกมนี้ชื่อลักพาตัว"" (สนพ.เอ็นเธอร์) หรือชื่อใหม่ว่า ""เกมรักพาตัว"" (สนพ.ไดฟุคุลิท) เป็นนิยายแนวชิงไหวชิงพริบ มีเรื่องความรักแบบสต็อคโฮมซินโดรม(ความผูกพันระหว่างโจรเรียกค่าไถ่กับคนถูกลักพาตัว)

นี่เป็นหนึ่งในนิยายน้อยเรื่องมากๆ ของคุณเคโงะที่พระเอกนางเอกยังเป็นวัยหนุ่มสาวทั้งคู่
แถมยังเน้นอีกต่างหากว่านางเอกสวยมากและหุ่นดีสุดๆ (นอกจากเรื่องนี้ มีแค่นางเอกของ ""พระอาทิตย์เที่ยงคืน"" เท่านั้นแหล่ะค่ะ ที่คุณเคโงะจะระบุเรื่องความงามชัดขนาดนี้)

""เกมนี้ชื่อลักพาตัว"" เล่าจากมุมมองแบบสรรพนามบุรุษที่ 1 ก็เลยทำให้เราอ่านไม่ถนัดเท่าไรเพราะเราไม่ชิน เพราะปกติ คุณเคโงะมักจะเล่าผ่านมุมมองแบบพระเจ้ากับมุมมองสรรพนามบุรุษที่ 3
อีกอย่าง เรื่องนี้เวอร์ชั่นเดิมที่ตีพิมพ์กับเอ็นเธอร์ก็ตั้งแต่ 2002 มาแล้ว ครั้งแรกที่พิมพ์ในญี่ปุ่นคงเก่ากว่านั้นมาก พอหลายๆ อย่างรวมกันเลยทำให้รู้สึกไม่เหมือนกำลังอ่านงานคุณเคโงะอยู่เลยล่ะค่ะ

วิธีการเล่าเรื่องนี้มันเหมาะจะหยิบไปสร้างหนังโรแมนติกธริลเล่อร์มาก เพราะตัวละครแต่ละคนนี่เก่งเว่อร์วังสุดๆ เรามีหมั่นไส้พระเอกนางเอกหลายรอบอยู่ คือต่างฝ่ายต่างเป็นมนุษย์มั่นใจแบบออกนอกหน้ามาก แต่ก็...นะ เค้าเก่งกันจริงๆ ล่ะค่ะ

อ่านเล่มนี้แล้วชวนให้นึกถึง ""ฉันหายไปในวันหยุด"" ของโอตสึอิจิ
เล่มนั้นก็ธีมลักพาตัวเหมือนกันค่ะ แต่ในแง่ความสมจริงและความสนุก เราว่า ""เกมนี้ชื่อลักพาตัว"" สนุกกว่าค่ะ

เรื่อง ""โหงวเฮ้ง"" ที่เกริ่นไป อ่านแล้วเราชอบนะคะ มีเรื่องโหงวเฮ้งพูดไว้จริงๆ มันอยู่ในเกมที่พระเอกเป็นคนสร้าง คือคุณเคโงะนำเสนอมุมมองเรื่องโหงวเฮ้งต่างไปจากที่เราคุ้นชินค่ะ เราอาจจะชินว่าโหงวเฮ้งคือสิ่งที่ติดตัวมาแต่เกิด และมันสามารถแปลความหมายออกมาได้เพื่อดูว่าคนๆ หนึ่งจะประสบความสำเร็จหรือล้มเหลวในอนาคตหรือไม่

แต่ในเล่มนี้บอกว่า ""ชะตาชีวิตไม่ได้ถูกกำหนดตามหน้าตา
ระยะทางการดำเนินชีวิตที่ผ่านมาต่างหากที่เป็นตัวกำหนดหน้าตา
หน้าตาเป็นแค่ผล แต่การดำเนินนชีวิตเพื่อให้ได้หน้าตานั้นมาน่าจะสำคัญกว่า""

สรุปง่ายๆ คือ ""ประสบการณ์สร้างใบหน้า แล้วใบหน้านั้นเป็นตัวกำหนดโชคชะตา"" ค่ะ",4,13 likes,7

কেইগো হিগাশিনো, আমাদের দেশে সবার আগে পরিচিতি পেয়েছেন 'দ্য ডিভোশন অব সাসপেক্ট এক্স'-এর লেখক হিসেবে। এরপর একই সিরিজের দ্বিতীয় বই 'দ্য সেইন্ট'ও পাঠকপ্রিয়তা পেয়েছে। গুডরিডসে 'দ্য নেইম অব দ্য গেইম ইজ আ কিডন্যাপিং' বইটা তার বইগুলার মাঝে সবচেয়ে কম রেটিং পেয়েছে (৩.৭৬)। তারপরও, বইটা যে অনবদ্য, সেটা স্বীকার করতেই হবে।

প্লট : সাকুমা, এড এজেন্সির দারুণ কর্মী, যে তার কাস্টমারের ওপর ক্ষেপে যায় তাকে তার পদ থেকে হঠানোর কারণে। প্রতিশোধ নেওয়ার সুযোগের খোঁজে তার কাস্টমার, কাতসুতোশি কাতসুরাগি'র বাড়ির আশপাশে ঘোরার সময় তার দেখা হয়ে যায় বাপের অবাধ্য মেয়ে জুরি কাতসুরাগির সাথে। দুজনে এবার এক কিডন্যাপিঙের নাটক সাজায়, যেটা নিশ্ছিদ্র করাই শেষ চ্যালেঞ্জ ছিল না। দুর্ভাগ্যক্রমে, খেলা এতই অভাবিত দিকে মোড় নেয় যে কার বিরুদ্ধে খেলছে আর আসলে কে খেলছে, তা নিয়েই বিপাকে পড়তে হয় সাকুমা এবং পাঠককে। একটা 'সেয়ানে সেয়ানে' টক্কর উপভোগ করার জন্য এই বইটা পড়তে পারন- তবে 'সেয়ান'টা আদতে কে বা কারা, সেটাই ধরতে পারবেন না।

ভালোমন্দ : প্রটাগনিস্ট সাকুমা-ই পাঠককে টেনে ধরার প্রথম কারণ। কর্পোরেট দুনিয়ার শেকড়ছাড়া লোক, সব চ্যালেঞ্জই যার কাছে একেকটা খেলা। তার প্রচন্ড প্রতিযোগী মনোভাব আর বুদ্ধিমত্তা, কাহিনীকে চমৎকার মাত্রা দিয়েছে। জুরি, কাতসুতোশি, এই চরিত্রগুলোও ভালো কন্ট্রিবিউট করেছে গল্পে।

বইটার ন্যারেটিভ পাঠককে পড়ে যেতে উদ্বুদ্ধ করে, আর অনুবাদকও সেটা তুলে ধরেছেন ভালোই।

একটা কিডন্যাপের খেলা সাজানো হচ্ছে (যেটা নাম থেকে পাঠক অনুমান করতেই পারবেন), তাকে নিশ্ছিদ্র করার জন্য কত ফাঁকফোকর চিন্তা করা হয়েছে, আবার পুলিশের হাত থেকে প্ল্যান বাঁচানোর জন্যও যা করা হয়েছে, তা মনে ধরবার মতো। আর পুরো খেলা সম্পন্ন হবার পর। শেষ পঞ্চাশ পৃষ্ঠায় পুরো ছক পালটে যাবার যে ট্যুইস্ট রয়েছে, সেটাই বইয়ের সবথেকে চমৎকার অংশ। আপনার মনে হতে পারে এটাও প্রেডিক্টেবল, কিন্তু পুরো ব্যাপারটা খোলাসা করার পর যেটা দেখা যাবে, সেটা একেবারেই অভাবিত ছিল, আর এখানেই কেইগো হিগাশিনো ভাস্বর।

বইয়ের আগাগোড়া : সজল ভাইয়ের সেরা কাজের একটা না হলেও, প্রচ্ছদের রং আর পৃষ্ঠার রং বইটা পড়াইয় ভালোলাগা যোগ করেছে। জ্যাকেটের নিচে মলাটে প্রচ্ছদ ছাপা নেই, এটা খারাপ লেগেছিল।

রক্তিম ভাইয়ের অনুবাদের দক্ষতা অনেক পাকাপোক্ত হয়েছে এই বইয়ে এসে। একদম মানসম্মত অনুবাদ, আর মাঝে মাঝে নাম-গুলোর অর্থ বুঝাতে জাপানি বর্ণ ব্যবহার করে ব্যবচ্ছেদ দেখানো-টাও ভালো লেগেছে। হয়ত ইংরেজি অনুবাদেও সেটা ছিল।
অনুবাদক এর আগে একই লেখকের 'স্যালভেশন অব আ সেইন্ট' অনুবাদ করছিলেন। তার মাঝেই বইটা বাজারে আসার ঘোষণা দেয় একটা প্রকাশনী, তখন সেটা ছেড়ে হিগাশিনোর এই বইটা ধরেন তিনি। এবং 'গুডরিডসে সবচে কম রেটিং পাওয়া বইটা'-কে বাংলাদেশি পাঠকদের কাছে সমান গ্রহণযোগ্য করে তোলার কৃতিত্ব আমি অনুবাদককেই দিব।

Tuy không nhấn vào chủ đề tâm lý xã hội sâu sắc như những cuốn khác nhưng cũng có các câu thoại châm biếm thú vị. Ấn tượng nhất là những đoạn Sakuma nói về ''mặt nạ''. Mỗi người chúng ta trong cuộc sống tùy lúc phải cố đeo lên những chiếc ''mặt nạ'' khác nhau để thích nghi với hoàn cảnh, các mối quan hệ xã hội phức tạp.

I understand that it isn't always possible to work with the same translator but a good translation is supposed to make the reader forget she's not reading the original work and that is simply not the case here. I had been eagerly waiting this novel (it was originally supposed to be released in early January but the date was changed twice) and I am very disappointed.

review_3579803465,Jessica Woodbury,"Oct 05, 2020","A very very different Higashino than usual. Though you have the meticulous plot full of twists and turns, everything else feels like a different writer all together.

The biggest obstacle for Higashino fans is likely our narrator, who is a total jerk. The unlikable female narrator is something we've talked about a lot in the last decade or so, but the unlikable male narrator is another thing all together. This guy sucks and he sucks enough that you can tell there is no way that he is going to be redeemed or see the error of his ways by the end of the book. So you have to know you're going in to a book where this guy is going to be sizing up women and playing stupid games of masculinity with men and that is just the thing.

All that said, it is a unique mystery and one that mostly works because our guy sucks so much. A good person would not do the stuff he does. So I see what Higashino is doing here and it mostly works. I didn't get to revel in it as much as I do with his best stuff, but he's always interesting and even if you have some suspicions that there's more here than meets the eye, the twists are legitimately surprising. The pacing is the biggest flaw, it's a very short third act with most of the twists all packed in together. But I admit, I was so pleased to find a Higashino that I was willing to forgive a multitude of sins.",3,5 likes,7

This may not be my most favorite book from Keigo Higashino, but it definitely is still gripping and surprising as ever. The excitement may take a while but once you get over the 40% marker everything will just zoom by. I also love the plot twist here!!!

Keigo Higashino is definitely my favorite author this year and I only have two translated works left to read from him! What I love about his works is that each one gives you a different flavor but you'll definitely taste the familiarity present in it as well. I love the fact that he experiments with the structure of his plots in every book and its straightforward prose remains magnetic.

The Name of the Game is Kidnapping might not be my most favorite from him because I have no emotional attachment to the characters as opposed to his other works (in which I cried or really cared for the cast). However, the fact remains that this one is still an enjoyable and quick read to satisfy the readers' cravings for murder mystery.",4,5 likes,7

Mình công nhận đây là một cốt truyện khá độc đáo và cách kết thúc khiến mình khá bất ngờ. Mình có thử đoán trước cái kết nhưng hóa ra vẫn sai. Câu chuyện chỉ được kể từ góc nhìn của Sakuma, nhân vật chính, nên rõ ràng đó là ý đồ của tác giả khi cố ý để người đọc chỉ biết được một phía của sự việc. Vì vậy, không chỉ ở cốt truyện thú vị, mà còn là cải cảm giác khi đọc truyện, mình thấy bồn chồn, không yên, luôn cảm thấy có gì đó không ổn, có gì đó sẽ khiến Sakuma gặp rắc rối. Mình chỉ theo dõi được diễn tiến sự việc từ phía Sakuma mà không biết đổi thủ có phản ứng và hành động như thế nào.

Mình rất ấn tượng với cách tác giả xoay chuyển, biến tấu chủ đề về bắt cóc. Lấy bắt cóc là một trò chơi thử tài của Sakuma, ta thấy một động cơ mấu chốt không phải là vì tiền, hay vì trả thù như những hành động phạm tội khác. Ở đây chỉ đơn thuần là một sự thử thách, một kiểu trổ tài, để cho thấy khả năng và năng lực của bản thân với một đối thủ đã dám đánh giá thấp mình. Điều đó đã là đủ để gợi nên sự tò mò ở người đọc. Một người chưa từng phạm tội bao giờ, bây giờ phải thực hiện một hành động nguy hiểm cần đến nhiều sự tính toán và lên kế hoạch tỉ mỉ, không được phép sai sót, nhưng không phải để trả thù - với mình, đó chỉ là sự đáp trả của lòng tự trọng đã bị xúc phạm nặng nề, đòi hỏi một lời giải thích xứng đáng. Không vì tiền, vì tình, vì trả thù, mà đơn thuần là vì cái tôi cá nhân và vì muốn chứng minh bản thân với đối thủ.

Và để kết hợp với một cốt truyện gây tò mò, thu hút người đọc như vậy thì không thể thiếu đến nhân vật chủ chốt Sakuma. Mở đầu truyện đã cho thấy Sakuma không phải là một nhân vật tốt bụng, dễ mến. Anh kiêu ngạo, tham vọng, đắc ý với những gì mình thể hiện. Anh có những tính chất của một alpha male đặc thù, coi phụ nữ như một dạng công cụ phục vụ cho dục vọng của mình. Tác giả xây dựng Sakuma thành một kiểu người đáng ghét, coi thường phụ nữ, chỉ biết đến cá nhân và đề cao bản thân hết thảy. Anh ta ích kỉ, vô cảm, vô tình. Nhưng dù như vậy, mình vẫn rất thích Sakuma và cảm thấy anh đặc biệt hấp dẫn. Vì luôn giữ một cái đầu lạnh, tỉnh táo nên Sakuma mới nghĩ ra ý tưởng liều lĩnh như vậy. Và vì tác giả đã xây dựng Sakuma là một con người hiếu thắng, tự tin, việc anh quyết định thực hiện kế hoạch đó càng làm tăng cái kịch tính của sự đối đầu giữa những bộ óc thông minh và xảo quyệt. Nhưng không ai ngờ kế hoạch được khởi động nhờ vào sự tình cờ liên quan đến cô con gái của đối thủ.

Cả quá trình lên kế hoạch và thực hiện nó cho thấy những sự mưu tính rất tỉ mỉ của Sakuma. Anh hành động hoàn toàn theo logic và lý trí. Anh phân tích từng bước đi khả thi của mình và dự đoán phản ứng từ đối thủ. Từ đó, anh quyết định xem nên làm gì tiếp theo, và cách thực hiện như thế nào. Phải nói là Sakuma suy xét vô cùng kĩ lưỡng từ mọi khía cạnh để đảm bảo kế hoạch thành công. Trong quá trình thực hiện từng bước, anh không ngừng theo dõi trạng thái và hành động của đối thủ. Anh quan sát và tự rút ra những nghi vấn hay kết luận để xác định bước tiêp theo. Vì mình đang thích Sakuma rồi, nên những nghi vẫn của anh khiến mình rất lo lắng. Việc tác giả không cho phép người đọc biết về suy nghĩ của đối phương khiến người đọc và Sakuma đang ở cùng trên một chiếc thuyền - chính người đọc không thể biết được những nguy cơ đe dọa tới kế hoạch của Sakuma. Khi kế hoạch kết thúc, thành công, mình thở phào, nhưng đồng thời cảm thấy có gì đó khuất tất. Vẫn còn nhiều điểm không khớp. Đến lúc này thì tác giả xoay chuyển tình thế. Đó là một cú twist - không chỉ với người đọc - trời giáng vào kế hoạch hoàn hảo của Sakuma. Chuyện gì đang xảy ra? Tất cả trò chơi này, với Sakuma, la nghiêm túc, nhưng với đối phương, điều đó nghĩa là gì? Sự thật được phơi bày còn đáng sợ hơn nhiều so với những gì Sakuma nghĩ, nó không hề đơn giản mà là một sự che đậy tài tình.

Một điều nữa rất đáng khen là tác giả biết sử dụng các nhân vật không hề tốt đẹp để tham gia vào câu chuyện này. Ngoài ra, mối quan hệ tình cảm giữa Sakuma và nhân vật nữ không khiến mình phải đảo mắt hay ngán ngẩm. Sakuma không vì tình cảm mà bị lung lay. Anh gắn bó với trò chơi này từ đầu đến cuối, suy nghĩ thấu đáo, tình cảm với anh chỉ là một bước đệm để đảm bảo sự cam kết của những người tham gia - dù tình cảm đó phát sinh trong vô thức. Vì Sakuma không phải là người tốt, nên anh không bị xáo trộn bởi lương tâm quá nhiều. Tuy vậy, khi mọi chuyện trật đường ray, Sakuma đã mất đi vẻ điềm tĩnh, lạnh lùng của mình và trở thành một con người đầy lo lắng, bất an - ở đây, tác giả đã cho thấy phần mềm yếu, dễ tổn thương của Sakuma, một con người đã phải quen độc lập, quen tỏ ra mạnh mẽ, quen với việc đeo mặt nạ để che giấu ""shadow"" của mình. Vậy là, cuốn sách này còn nói về việc đón nhận phần ""shadow"" trong mỗi con người như thế nào để phát triển cá nhân và nhận thức bản thân.",5,5 likes,7

Thứ nhất, mạch truyện rời rạc đọc mệt mỏi thực sự ấy. Kiểu trinh thám nhưng mà nó không làm mình cuốn một chút nào.
Thứ hai, giá trị nhân văn gần như bằng 0 với một tác phẩm không có lấy 1 nhân vật chính diện để mình support hic.",2,5 likes,7

❝যদি তুমি তোমার আসল চেহারা সবার কাছে প্রকাশ করে দাও, তবে একদিন তোমার অজান্তে সে মুখের ওপর আঘাত পড়বেই। গোটা দুনিয়াটা একটা খেলায় ময়দান। এই খেলার ময়দানে—খেলা বুঝে তোমাকে মুখোশ পরতে হবে।❞

ওপরের সংলাপের অংশটি গভীর ভাবার্থ বহনকারী উক্তি। বাস্তবিক প্রেক্ষাপটের সাথে মিলে যায়; এইরকম অনেক উক্তিই এই বইয়ে গ্রথিত হয়েছে। লেখক কেইগো হিগাশিনো সম্পর্কে আমরা সকলেই অবগত; অন্তত যারা জাপানিজ বইগুলোর ভক্ত। তিনি চরিত্রদের বিচারবিবেচনা নিয়ে খেলতে ভীষণ স্বাচ্ছন্দ্য বোধ করেন। এই বইয়ের ক্ষেত্রেও সেই প্রক্রিয়ার ব্যতিক্রম হয়নি।

❛দ্য নেম অব দ্য গেম ইজ অ্যা কিডন্যাপিং❜ বইয়ের মূল বিষয়বস্তু হচ্ছে অপহরণ, ইংরেজিতে কিডন্যাপিং। আমি ‘অপহরণ’ বলেই সম্বোধন করছি। কথা হচ্ছে, এই অপহরণের লুক্কায়িত বিষয়বস্তু কী নিয়ে—তা জানার জন্য আগ্রহ বোধ হতে পারে। বলছি, তার পূর্বে বলেনি—এইখানে অপহরণকে একটি ত্রুটিশূন্য ও মনস্তাত্ত্বিক খেলার মধ্যখানের বিষয় হিসেবে চিহ্নিত করানো হয়েছে। অর্থাৎ অপহরণ সঠিক লক্ষ্যস্থল হলেও কাজটি হয়েছে সম্পূর্ণ ভিন্নভাবে। গভীর পর্যবেক্ষণ দৃষ্টি দিয়ে যখন পুরো বই পড়া শেষ হবে; তবেই এর ভাবাদর্শগত বৈশিষ্ট্য সামনে আসবে—এর পূর্বে নয়। বেশ কঠিন করে বলে ফেললাম বোধ হয়?

যাহোক, সহজেভাবে বললে—বইটিকে অতি সাধারণ মনে হতে পারে; তাই একটু ঘুরপ্যাঁচে ব্যক্ত করলাম। এই বইয়ে কে কার চেয়েও বড়ো খেলোয়াড়; এই নিয়েও আমোদ-প্রমোদ-এর ব্যবস্থা রাখা হয়েছে। নিছক মনোরঞ্জনের জন্য তো নয়। পাঠক যেন কোনোভাবে স্বস্তি থাকতে না পারে, সেই উদ্দেশে লেখক পুরো গল্পটি সাজানোর প্রচেষ্টা করেছে। বইয়ের অবসানে না আসা পর্যন্ত কারও ধারণায় থাকবে না যে—এইরকম একটি ঘটনা গঠতেও পারে; তা-ও এইভাবে!

➲ আখ্যান—

সাকুমা খুবই দক্ষ, চটপটে একজন অ্যাড এজেন্ট। কর্মক্ষেত্র কিংবা প্রেম—সবই তার কাছে খেলার মতো, যেই খেলায় ‘হার’ বলে কিছু নেই। ঠিক যখনই নিসেই কোম্পানিতে তার ক্যারিয়ারের সবচেয়ে বড়ো প্রজেক্টটা আলোর মুখ দেখতে ধরেছিল, ঠিক তখনোই নিসেই’র এক্সিকিউটিভ ভাইস প্রেসিডেন্ট কাতসুতোশি কাতসুরাগি রীতিমতো অপমান করে তা বাতিল করে দেয়।

কাতসুতোশি কাতসুরাগি’র কাছে কর্মক্ষেত্র মানেই খেলার ময়দান। যেখানে প্রতিটা পরিকল্পনা, প্রতিটা পদক্ষেপ হওয়া চাই নিখুঁত। একটু এদিকওদিক হলেই নিশ্চিত ‘হার’। আর তিনি হারার জন্য এত বড়ো কোম্পানির হাল ধরেননি। জিতই তার একমাত্র লক্ষ্য।

কাতসুরাগির কন্যা জুরি’র সাথে সাকুমার যখন ঘটনাচক্রে এক হবার সুযোগ হয়ে যায় তখন সে বুঝতে পারে প্রেম-কর্মক্ষেত্র ছাপিয়ে আরো এক জায়গায় তার খেলার সময় এসে গেছে।

আর সেই খেলার নাম—কিডন্যাপিং।

➤ পাঠ প্রতিক্রিয়া ও পর্যালোচনা—

❛দ্য নেম অব দ্য গেম ইজ অ্যা কিডন্যাপিং❜ খুবই সুখপাঠ্য একটি বই। নির্ভেজাল তবে উত্তেজনাকর পরিপূর্ণ রিভেঞ্জ থ্রিলার। গল্প ছিল স্মুথ আর আকর্ষণীয়। গতানুগতিক প্লট মনে হলেও, গল্পের প্রগাঢ়তা ভালোই অনুভব করিয়েছে। জীবনদর্শনের অংশের ব্যাপ্তি কম হলেও বাস্তবতা উপলব্ধি করানোর মতোই। সাসপেন্স ও টুইস্ট সমানুপাতিক। সব মিলিয়ে দারুণ।

● সূত্রপাত—

গল্পের শুরুটা সাকুমা নামের এক যুবককে ঘিরে। দৈনন্দিন কাজগুলোর মধ্যে সকালে উঠে ব্যায়াম করা ও কম ক্যালরি রয়েছে এমন খাবার খাওয়ার মধ্যে সীমাবদ্ধ থাকা। কর্মক্ষেত্র বলতে একটি বিজ্ঞাপন কোম্পানি। লাইফ গোল হিসেবে রয়েছে, বিয়ে না করার চিন্তা ও মেয়ে নিয়ে ফুর্তি করার মনমানসিকতা। সব মিলিয়ে ভালো চললেও, বিপত্তি ঘটে কর্মক্ষেত্রের একটি প্রজেক্ট নিয়ে। ঠিক তখন থেকেই শুরু হয় একটি শখের ও প্রতিশোধের পরিকল্পনা। সহজ ও বুদ্ধিদীপ্ত হলেও খেলাটা যে কতটা কঠিন দিকে মোড় নিচ্ছে, আর কীভাবে; সেটা জানতে হলে বইটি নিয়ে বসতে হবে।

● গল্প বুনট—

সহজবোধ্য লেখনশৈলী দিয়ে সাজানো পুরো গল্পে মনোযোগ দেওয়া ও ভাবার মতো অনেকগুলো সিকোয়েন্স রয়েছে। একটি নিখুঁত থ্রিলার গল্প পড়ার উদাহরণ হিসেবে এই বইয়ের কথা অনেকদিন মনে থাকবে। সিকোয়েন্স সাজানো থেকে খুঁটিনাটি অনেক বিষয়বস্তু অতি পুঙ্খানুপুঙ্খভাবে গল্পের সাথে মিলিয়ে দেওয়ার প্রয়াসকে সাধুবাদ জানাতে হচ্ছে। প্রত্যকটি অধ্যায় হাওয়াই মিঠাইয়ের অনুভূতি দিচ্ছিল। এই নিলাম, আর শেষ করলাম। আমি বইকে টানতে হয়নি, বইয়ের গল্প আমাকে শেষ পর্যন্ত টেনে নিতে সহায়তা করেছে; তা-ও বিনা বাধাবিপত্তি ছাড়াই।

● লেখনশৈলী—

মোলায়েম লেখনশৈলী। একেবারে স্বচ্ছ ও শান্ত পানির মতোই। কোনো জটিলতা নেই। সংলাপ, বাক্য গঠনে বিচক্ষণতা ও ছোটো কয়েকটি সাবপ্লটে সল্প বর্ণনার দিকগুলো সুন্দরভাবে ফুটিয়ে তুলেছে। গল্পের প্রেক্ষাপট ও চরিত্রদের সাথে সংযোগ করার মতো দিকটিও সাবলীল লেখনশৈলীর কারণে হয়েছে।

অবশ্যই সে-জন্য, মূল ইংরেজি অনুবাদক ও বাংলা অনুবাদক রক্তিম দাদাকে অসংখ্য ধন্যবাদ। সহজবোধ্যভাবে বইটি মূল লেখকের লেখার অনুকরণ করার জন্য।

● বর্ণনাশৈলী—

❛দ্য নেম অব দ্য গেম ইজ অ্যা কিডন্যাপিং❜ বইয়ের প্লট আমাদের চেনাজানা হলেও, উপস্থাপনা একটি বিশেষ দিক হিসেবে চিহ্নিত করতে হয়। বর্ণনাশৈলীর দিকটি লেখক বেশ পোক্ত হাতে সামলেছেন দেখে ভালো লাগছে। গল্পের প্লটে কানেক্টেড হওয়ার মতো পারিপার্শ্বিক বিষয়বস্তু ও চরিত্রের কার্যাবলি আলাদাভাবে নজর কেড়েছে। সব মিলিয়ে পুরো গল্পের প্রেক্ষাপটে সহজে মিশে যেতে পেরেছি।

● চরিত্রায়ন—

চরিত্রের সংখ্যা খুবই সীমিত। গল্পের প্রেক্ষাপটের সাথে সামঞ্জস্যপূর্ণ। সাকুমার দৃষ্টিকোণ থেকে পুরো গল্পটি লেখা হয়েছে। অর্থাৎ উত্তম পুরুষে। সংলাপের মাধ্যমে অন্য চরিত্রের কথোপকথনে তাদের ব্যক্তি বৈশিষ্ট্য অবলোকিত করা গিয়েছে। প্রত্যকটি চরিত্রের বিশেষত্বের সাথে অতীতের কিছু ঘটনার রূপরেখা সুনিপুণভাবে দেখিয়েছে। যা গল্পের মর্যাদা বৃদ্ধি করতে সহায়তা করেছে।

● অবসান—

শেষটা বুদ্ধিচাতুর্যে নির্ধারিত। এইরকম কিছু হবে ভেবেছি। শুরু থেকে যে-ভাবে চরিত্র বিল্ডাপ দিয়েছে, সেই দিক থেকে এইরকম একটি সমাপ্তি না দিলে বরং অন্যায় হয়ে যেত। তাই ভালো লাগার প্রবণতা বেশি ছিল। যেহেতু পুরোটাই একটি অপহরণের খেলা, কিন্তু এই খেলার জয়ী কে বা কে কাকে টেক্কা দিয়েছে তা গল্প শেষ হয়েও হলো না শেষ।

● খুচরা আলাপ—

অনেক আলাপ করে ফেলেছি বইটি নিয়ে। আরও মিছু করা যাক। অপহরণ নিয়ে অনেক ক্রাইম থ্রিলার পড়ে থাকলেও, এই গল্পে কে যে মূল অপরাধী আর কে কার থেকে সেরা; সেই বিষয়বর্ণন নিয়ে উৎকৃষ্ট একটি গল্প লিখেছেন লেখক। হার্টবিটের গতি কিছুটা হলেও বাড়িয়ে দিতে সক্ষম হয়েছে ❛দ্য নেম অব দ্য গেম ইজ অ্যা কিডন্যাপিং❜ উপন্যাসটি।

আমাদের সমাজে কিছু মুখোশধারী মানুষ রয়েছে যারা সব কিছু নিজেদের আয়ত্তে রাখতে পছন্দ করে। এই মুখোশের আড়ালে থাকা সত্য নিয়েও লেখক যৌক্তিক আলোকপাত করেছেন।

❝এক সপ্তাহে ব্যবহার করার জন্য তুমি প্রায় দশ হাজার আশি মিনিট পাও।❞

মানুষ আক্ষেপ করে যে তাদের হাতে না-কি সময় থাকে না। আমিও এই আক্ষেপের কান্ডারি। অথচ নিজেকে নিয়ে ভাবার জন্য আমরা ত্রিশ মিনিট সব ব্যয় করতে খুবই হেলাফেলা করি। যা একদমই উচিত নয়। এই বইয়ে সময়ের গুরুত্ব সম্পর্ক বেশ ভালোই জোর দেওয়া হয়েছে; যা পড়লেই বুঝতে পারবেন।

❝আপনার চেহেরার ওপর আপনার ভবিষ্যৎ নির্ভর করে না। বরং আপনার কাজের ওপর আপনার চেহেরা নির্ভর করে।❞

চেহারা দেখে বিচার, ভক্তি, শ্রদ্ধা বা সম্মান দেখানোর দিন এখন আর নেই। চেহেরা মন্দ হলেও, কাজ ভালো হোক। কাজ ভালো হলে, ভবিষ্যতের দরজা অটোমেটিক খুলে যাবে। আর আইডেনটিটি হিসেবে চেহেরা তখন প্যাটার্ন আনলকড সিস্টেম হিসেবে কাজ করবে। সফলতাও নেই, সুন্দর চেহেরার কোনো মূল্যও নেই। এই উক্তিটির প্রভাব বইয়ে ভালোভাবেই আছে। এক্ষেত্রে ‘আগে দর্শনদারি তো পরে গুনবিচারি’ প্রবাদ বাক্যটির মর্মার্থ এখানে—একেবারেই বেকার বলে মনে হবে।

❝এ জগতে টাকার চেয়েও অনেক দামি জিনিস রয়েছে। আমার কাছে মনে হয়, ‘মানুষের হৃদয়’ আর ‘সময়’এরকম দুটো অমূল্য জিনিস।❞

টাকার চেয়েও দামি জিনিস থাকলেও, কেন যেন আমরা সেই টাকাকে সবচেয়ে ‘দামি’ মনে করি। এই টাকার জন্য অনেক কিছুর শুরুটা হয়ে উঠে না। শেষটা না-হয় হৃদয় দিয়ে জয় করা সম্ভব; কিন্তু শুরুর জন্য টাকা অতিশয় প্রয়োজনীয়। বিবেক দিয়ে ভাবলে এই দিকটি যুক্তিযুক্ত মনে হতে বাধ্য তবে—মানুষের মন এবং সময় আক্ষরিক অর্থে টাকা দিয়ে কেনা সম্ভব নয়। আবার টাকা থাকলে অসম্ভব কিছু নয়। বিষয়টি বেশ বিভ্রান্তিকর। অনেকটা ‘ডিম আগে না মুরগি আগে’ টাইপ মনে হতে পারে।

তবে বেঁচে থাকার মতো পর্যাপ্ত টাকা, ভালো বাসার মতো একজন খাঁটি মানুষ ও জীবনকে উপভোগ জন্য ভালো কিছু সময়—এটাই যথেষ্ট হওয়া উচিত। আপনার সময় আছে টাকা নেই, টাকা থাকলে ভালোবাসা নেই, ভালোবাসা থাকলে আবার সময় নেই। এইভাবে টাইম লুপে ঘুরে জীবন অতিবাহিত না করার চেয়ে—একজন পছন্দের মানুষের সাথে পর্যাপ্ত টাকা দিয়ে দুমুঠো ডালভাত খেয়ে মাথা গোঁজার মতো স্থানে সময়টা উপভোগ করলে বরং ভালো হয়। এতে শান্তি পাওয়া যায়। কারণ, জিন্দেগি না মিলেগি দোবারা... এক জীবনে সব সুখ চাইলে পাওয়া যায় না। চেষ্টার কমতি না রাখলে হয়তো পাওয়া যায়।

❝যে-কোনো পরিবারে একজন সন্তান-সহ ডিভোর্সি নারী সব সময় আপদের মতোই মনে হয়।❞

বাস্তব। খুবই বাস্তব। পরিসংখ্যানের দিকে তাকালে, এই সমস্যাটা এশিয়ান দেশগুলোতে ভালো পরিমাণে দেখা যায়। আমাদের দেশে এই সংখ্যা নেহাত কম নয় বলে জানি। এই বিষয়টি একটি খোলামেলা ট্যাবু। সরাসরি কেউ এই নিয়ে কথা বলে আবার অনেক বলে না। শহরে ও গ্রামের উদাহরণ এই অভিমুখে দেওয়া যায়। তবে এর বিপরীতও কিছু দিক রয়েছে। সেইসব নিয়ে অন্য কোনো বইয়ের রিভিউতে আলোচনা হবে৷
⚊
যাহোক, অনেক কিছু নিয়ে টুকটাক আলাপ করলাম। বাকিটা বই পড়ে না-হয় জেনে নিবেন।

➣ লেখক ও অনুবাদক নিয়ে কিছু কথা—

কেইগো হিগাশিনো ইতোমধ্যে আমাদের দেশে বেশ জনপ্রিয়। অন্তত যারা থ্রিলার পাঠক আছেন তাদের নিকট উনি ভালোই সমাদৃত। ওনার নাম-ই যথেষ্ট বই হাতে তুলে নেওয়ার জন্য। আরও কাজ হোক ওনার বই নিয়ে। ইত্যবসরে পছন্দের লেখকের একজন তিনি।

অনুবাদক রক্তিম দাদা চ্যালেঞ্জ করে বলেছিলেন, এই বইটা ওনার করা সেরা কাজের একটি। সেরা কাজের একটি বলার কারণ, ভবিষ্যতে যে উনি আরও সেরা কাজ উপহার দিবেন এই নিয়ে দ্বিধাবোধ নেই। প্রাঞ্জল বর্ণনা, সঠিক শব্দচয়নে মানানসই বাক্য গঠন দিয়ে পুরো বইকে করেছেন সুখপাঠ্য। জাপানিজ থ্রিলার নিয়ে আরও কাজ হোক। আগামীতে জনপ্রিয় অ্যানিমি মাঙ্গা সিরিজগুলোর অনুবাদ আশা করছি অনুবাদক থেকে।

● সম্পাদনা ও বানান—

বানান বেশ ভালোই পরিমানে ভুল আছে বইয়ে। প্রচলিত অনেক বানান ভুল পরিলক্ষিত হয়েছে। তবে সম্পাদনা ভালো হয়েছে।

মূল বইয়ের দুটো অসংগতি পেয়েছি। যা খুবই সিলি বলে মনে হলো। যেমন—লাইসেন্স প্লেট থেকে নাম্বারের কীভাবে উদ্ধার করেছে সাকুমা? অন্যদিকে, হোটেলে চেক আউটের কথা থাকলেও সেই কাজটা আধো করেছে কি-না তা অজানা। যা তদন্তের করার ক্ষেত্রে একটি ত্রুটি বলে মনে হয়েছে।

● প্রচ্ছদ, নামলিপি—

প্রচ্ছদ আর নামলিপি দুটোই খাপে খাপ। সজল ভাইয়ের দৃষ্টিনন্দন কাজের মধ্যে এই কাজটি অন্যতম।

● মলাট, বাঁধাই, পৃষ্ঠা—

এই বইটা ভূমির সবচেয়ে স্মুথ প্রোডাকশন মনে হয়েছে। ধরতে এবং পড়তে দুটোই আরাম লেগেছে। বাইন্ডিং বেশ ভালো, মলাটও শক্তপোক্ত। বইয়ের মাঝে বা শেষে এসেও পুরোপুরি খোলা রেখে বইটা আরামে পড়া গিয়েছে। এই ফর্মার বইগুলোতে এই প্রোডাকশন আসলেই নজর কাড়ে।

review_2901858818,Sơn Lương,"Oct 13, 2019","Quyển này cũng đọc xong lâu rùi mà không review được, nay dựa trên những dòng note ngắn ngủi, mình quick review.

Tên Của Trò Chơi Là Bắt Cóc là một quyển khá lạ của Keigo Higashino vì lần đầu tiên ngôi kể là “tôi” chứ không phải ngôi thứ ba, và góc kể cũng vì thế mà khác đi: thay vì đi tìm lời giải cho một vụ án thì ta được chứng kiết quá trình lên âm mưu - cụ thể là một vụ bắt cóc của nam chính Sakuma, để trả đũa Katsuragi Katsutoshi, người dám chê bai năng lực mà anh luôn tự hào.

Những tưởng giữa Sakuma và người bị bắt cóc Juri sẽ xảy ra Hội chứng Stockholm, tức con tin yêu luôn kẻ bắt cóc, nhưng không, vụ bắt cóc mở ra một trò chơi mới, gây cấn mà Sakuma dành hết tâm huyết để lên kế hoạch.

Mọi thứ diễn ra đúng như Sakuma đã dự đoán, nhưng truyện của Keigo thì không thể đơn giản như vậy. Lúc mà Sakuma tưởng mình đã chiến thắng trò chơi do mình làm chủ từ đầu cũng là lúc anh nhận ra sự thật ngược lại, trò chơi bây giờ mới thực sự bắt đầu và chưa biết ai mới là người chiến thắng thật sự.

Truyện giàu tình tiết điện ảnh, có thể hình dung ra cảnh phim thì sẽ thế nào, mọi thứ im ắng chỉ còn tiếng tim đập hay kim đồng hồ quay chờ đến đúng khoảnh khắc mọi thứ diễn ra như kẻ bày mưu đã sắp đặt. Đây là một quyển hay, hấp dẫn, như một ván bài, 30 chưa phải tết, hãy đọc đến tận cùng mới biết kẻ thắng người thua.",4,5 likes,7

Last year, I started reading a lot of police-procedurals and noticed one thing - most authors didnt bother to explain the ""how"". The investigation would focus on patiently identifying the mistakes by the criminals. While those were indeed good reads, I liked Christie's old-fashioned way of explaining things. Agreed, sometimes her explanations were convoluted, but atleast there was an understanding that an explanation of the events would be given.
This was my third book by Keigo Higashino , after the super The Devotion of Suspect X and the decent Malice. Like ""the devotion..."", in this one too the events happened in plain sight for the readers. The question is can you guess the motives of every1 ? And can you see the larger picture ? Can you assemble a different puzzle from the jigsaw pieces ?

Higashino Keigo is, hands-down, one of the best Japanese crime writers I've read.

This book is long - longer than most crime fiction ought to be -- and so the first half was a bit diffuse, as the many relevant strands were being woven. Also, remembering all the Japanese names caused some confusion/difficult (for my aged brain) -- but, O! worth the wait...!",5,37 likes,8
review_1529871304,Riju Ganguly,"Jan 29, 2016","Books written by Keigo Higashino leave most of the readers pretty speechless with their clever twists & turns, adroit characterization, and the depth of emotions that lace the actions on part of all concerned. The book under review is, even by his standards, a masterpiece, that has literally left me stunned. I am actually finding it difficult to write a review of it, but still, one has to try.

A pawnbroker named Yosuke Kirihara was found murdered in an abandoned bulding. The body had been found by a kid named Kikuchi who, along-with other kids, used to play in the ducts inside the building. Suspecting that Kirihara had gone to that building on some adulterous fling, Police zoom on the only female customer of the pawnshop: Fumiyo Nishimoto, as well as a regular customer of the udon-shop where she works: Tadao Terasaki (jealousy-angle). They, also continue pursuing the widow Yaeko Kirihara, the pawnbroker’s assistant Isamu Matsuura, as well as the Kikuchi family (because the pawnbroker was carrying an unusually large amount of money that he had, most uncharacteristically, withdrawn from Bank). However, alibies were all cast-iron. Only person devoid of an alibi is Terasaki, who died shortly in an accident. And it seems that this would remain as another unsolved low-profile murder in the books of Osaka Police. However, Detective Sasagaki couldn’t let the case go, because he had noticed two pre-teen kids in this ruined & desolate landscape who were very special, and very captivating. For the next twenty years, even after he retired, he pursued those two persons: (1) the daughter of Fumiyo Nishimoto: Yukiho, (2) the son of the deceased: Ryo Kirihara. The book is a journey of those two, the unstoppable & insatiable white queen, and her ever-faithful dark knight.

While I had started reading the book knowing fully well that this is not going to be a mystery in the traditional sense (Higashino simply enjoys breaking all the ‘rules’ that we associate with a mystery), the book left me literally gasping for breath as I raced towards the end with the Detective. Was I eager to see their fall? Yes. Oh God, yes! I wanted them to be destroyed, killed, ruined, burnt alive, thrown to wolves, fed to the grinder, etc. And I also wanted to see just what height they can reach taking this dark road until someone comes with the thunder. And all along, I also felt very-very sorry for them, as I also started joining the dots inside my mind to understand exactly how they had started this walk.

The book is complex to the extent where the reader knows that at the end of this maze only the Minotaur would be waiting for him. It was unbelievably good, deeply unsatisfactory, and heartbreakingly tragic. Why? Because so many lives got destroyed, one fell, the other rose, and we kept walking under the midnight Sun. Perhaps, we might have another book that would eventually show someone crashing even that Olympian figure, and only then it would be the end of the night.

Sorry about the rambling. Now, I wouldn’t like to take up any more of your time. Please enjoy the read. What? You are having doubts about reading the book? Are you crazy? This is an essential read!

review_1560923784,Rach,"Feb 25, 2016","Yosuke Kirihara's dead body is found in an abandoned building, and Detective Sasagaki is unable to solve the case. Never one to give up, this novel traces the lives of the two main suspects over 18 years, with Sasagaki ever hovering in background.

To sum it up in one sentence, this is an infuriating and yet absorbing novel. One of the main flaws of this novel is that it is extremely hard to keep track of the characters mentioned. Higashino has the annoying tendency of introducing a seemingly endless cast of characters that appears for three paragraphs, only to have them vanish by the next. Some do pop up again in the future, but most are disposable and recyclable. It got to the point where I had to make a list to keep up, and finished the book with a total tally of approximately 20 (it got to the point where I just could not be bothered to keep track anymore), out of which most were only mentioned once, and never again.

To read and enjoy this novel, one must suspend one's common sense and logic. The reader must accept that (view spoiler) With the way this novel plays out, either the police force in Japan are extremely incompetent, or the author expects his reader to be unquestioningly stupid.

Despite the obvious weakness in the plot, I sped through this with ease, which is as per the case in most crime novels. Assuming you make it to the end of this 539 page paperback (Little, Brown; 2015 Edition), a most unsatisfying ending awaits you. Other crime novels exist, with better characters and tighter plots. Give this a try only if you are a masochist who enjoys being annoyed and unsatisfied.",2,27 likes,8

The most amazing part of this book is not the plot itself! Instead, try concentrating on the details that Higashino-sensei gave you (e.g., what kind of books did the officer saw when he entered the boy's room for the first time at the beginning of the fiction?) and you would be able to solve many quizzes that were not revealed by the author...

This interaction between storyteller and readers is the reason I rated it 5 instead of 4.",5,120 likes,8
review_1489429024,Yuhuai,"Jan 01, 2016","As a mystery: the story drags on for too long, introducing more and more subplots that ultimately did very little to advance the main plot. The author makes the reveal of the motive and 'trick' of each subplot self-evident to the extent that by the time the ultimate reveal comes, the reader is no longer interested. The ultimate reveal of the overall motive and 'trick' does little to justify the long setup, and the resolution is lacking in the way of consequences to the characters involved.

As a drama: the central protagonists are unsympathetic, not helped by the fact that readers only perceive them through the lenses of numerous underdeveloped secondary characters. The reveal about the protagonists' past is not interesting enough to inform their actions throughout the tiring amount of subplots introduced. It is not clear why the author needs to introduce an excessive amount of redundant subplots to establish the protagonists, or even what his overall objective was in terms of creating character arcs for the protagonists.",1,35 likes,8
review_1607017093,Jokoloyo,"Apr 10, 2016","I can understand if someone rate this book 5-star. The voice of this book unique, especially if the reader has not read any Keigo Higashino's work before. The plot itself is more to crime thriller than to mystery.

The easiest to notice of this book is the POVs. The POVs of this book mostly from minor characters. I find this a little bit boring, because it makes the story slow (for every POV, there is a background story). But, the author uses the background story blending with the setting setup.

The setting is Japan on era 1972/3 up to early 1990s. There are rarely explicit date on the story, but author insert the thick atmosphere by discussing the real-life/historical event (for example, you could guess the year when movie was a big hit at theatres, or when the Japan's economic rise and fall. Unfortunately, some of the references are based on sport events at Japan.)

This novel has rich Japanese taste, not only in the setting, but in the characters' actions and way of life. Some of the taste are unfortunately still lost in translations, but I believe the translator had done his best.

In conclusion, this is one of the best translated Japanese Thriller at the market nowadays. Maybe even the best Keigo Higashino's work that has been translated into English.",4,,8

The tiny details and how they all come together is perhaps the best part about this book. And the fact that no one is ever good or bad here. We are all capable of embracing darkness and this is something Higashino explores time and again. This novel is not for those looking for a resolution. This is not that kind of a story. It burns slow, a midnight sun.",4,27 likes,8
review_2560697304,Apoorva,"Oct 28, 2018","“You know how the sun rises and sets at a certain time each day? In the same way, all of our lives have a day and night. But it’s not set like it is with the sun. Some people walk forever in the sunlight, and some people have to walk through the darkest night their whole lives. When people talk about being afraid, what they’re afraid of is that their sun will set. That the light they love will fade.”

‘Journey under the midnight sun’ begins with the murder of a pawnbroker in an abandoned building in Osaka in 1973. Detective Sasagaki is assigned to investigate the crime. He uncovers a lot of clues and possible suspects, but the evidence isn’t enough to pin down a specific criminal. That’s why the case reaches a dead end and Sasagaki is forced to give up his investigation. He still continues to keeps tabs on two people involved in the crime, both related to the suspect and the victim in order to find their connection to the crime.

This book was absolutely brilliant! It is so much different from the other crime thrillers I’ve read; here, we follow the mystery and its effects for a long period of time. This novel takes place over a span of two decades and follows the lives of two people connected solely because of the crime and detective Sasagaki’s obsession with uncovering the truth, as he believes the crime has caused a ripple effect which impacts the lives of people even after 20 long years.

It had a unique, brilliantly crafted and intricate story-line. This was my second book by Keigo Higashino, after Devotion of Suspect X that I absolutely loved. One thing I noticed in his books that make them exceptional is that the mystery is not about who committed the crime but rather, how the crime was committed and the possible motivation behind it.



The story is told from multiple points of views so we get to experience it from the perspective of different characters, mostly the minor characters. From them, we learn different aspects of the same events and other characters which were really interesting. Following the timeline, we get to see all the changes along the way in Japan. There were a lot of references to the video games, computer technology, movies, baseball and economic changes which manages to capture the heart of the changing and progressing era of the country. It also gives an insight into the Japanese culture and the way of life.

As the story progresses, a lot of characters get introduced. It might be a little overwhelming at first, but everything comes together eventually just like different pieces in the puzzle fit to show the whole picture and in the end, you’re left gasping for air at what you see! The shifting point of views among the different characters kept the tension alive. The story kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time, making me feel all sorts of feels and caused me to question everything I’ve ever known!

This book truly is a masterpiece! If you’re a fan of thrillers and anything related to Japan, I highly recommend this book.",5,,8
review_3932665786,K.J. Charles,"Apr 07, 2021","Wow this was good. Wow. I think it's his best. This is a thriller on an epic scale, starting with the unsolved murder of a pawnbroker and the death of a woman he might have been having an affair with. The ramifications spool out as we follow events through twenty years, through the eyes of a huge cast who have greater or lesser involvement.

It's a pretty horrifying story (TW: rape, several) and the slow reveal of what happens is immensely creepy and compelling. It's also a fascinating portrait of Japan's rapid changes from the 70s and of various aspects of culture--school, business, dating, marriage, women's position. Goodness. Hugely impressive, shows what genre fiction can do.",0,25 likes,8
review_1765467430,Ms.pegasus,"Aug 08, 2017","The disturbing vibe that permeates this book draws on more than the damaged pair of characters tracked over the span of twenty years. It draws power from the gutters of Japanese society that fall under Higashino's impassive gaze. That sense of anomie is captured in the cover art, a photo of individuals on a busy urban sidewalk. The shot captures these people from behind. They are faceless vanishing shadows.

Higashino's initial setting is Osaka — the parts invisible to tourists but with which he no doubt was well acquainted with from growing up in this city. Governmental failure is subtly implied through a sequence of images. Detective Sasagaki glances at a trio of news headlines about public health endangerment due to pollution. The crime site he approaches is a partially built and then abandoned building permitted to stand despite being an eyesore and dangerous playground for neighborhood children. His interrogation takes him to “...a squat two-storey affair..in a cluster of small houses that looked as if they had been thrown together from corrugated tin siding and whatever lumber happened to be lying around at the time. Black splotches marked the building's sooty grey walls and serpentine lines of concrete had been plastered over the many cracks.”(p.23) The murder victim is a local pawn shop owner, and the police suspect robbery was the motive. That suspicion is reinforced by the information that he had withdrawn a sizeable amount of cash from the bank the same afternoon he was killed.

Higashino bookends his story between two economic crises: the 1973 oil embargo and the late 1980's real estate bubble collapse. Even middle school children hustle for spare change. Fumihiko Kikuchi, a middle school student, complains about being unable to afford going to the movies. Conversations with his friend Yuichi Akiyoshi always seem to be tinged with envy. The book is filled with scenes of extreme wealth and poverty juxtaposed, of secretive family units terrified of neighborhood gossip, a corrupted cultural legacy, superficiality, struggles for survival in a predatory food chain and human loneliness.

This is not a mystery. It is a suspenseful story told in over 500 pages. It is Higashino's storytelling ability that holds the reader's interest in such a hefty volume. The reader reacts with surprise when a connection is made to some seemingly insignificant or even accidental incident in a previous chapter. Likewise, the reader is tempted to predict what looks like a certain outcome to the presently unfolding events. Each chapter jumps to a succeeding time period, and introduces a new set of associates surrounding the main characters, a girl named Yukiho (Nishimoto) Karasawa, and a boy named Ryo Kirihara. Yukiho lived with her mother in the squat squalid building described above. Ryo was the son of Yosuke Kirihara, the pawnbroker who was murdered. Despite this proximity, there is a separateness to their stories. Some characters persist over more than one chapter. Others vanish only to reappear later. The temporary nature of these associations reinforces a sense of ad hoc and opportunistic relationships.

The reader's craving for continuity is satisfied by the invisible persistence of Detective Sasagaki. After the initial murder investigation, his appearance is intermittent and sometimes he is not even identified by name. Yet, he persists, even after the statute of limitations has expired, even after his own retirement, determined to uncover the trail of crimes and damaged lives that were set in motion by that one elusive murder case. Of all the characters, he is also the most opaque. Not even he can explain his obsession with this case.

Higashino employs extraordinary skill in writing this story. In its bare outline, the plot might seem like a mundane genre piece. There are parts that dissolve into pure melodrama. There are shades of gothic noir. Some of the unexpected turns will leave the reader gasping. Even at its conclusion, there is an element of ambiguity. Like Sasagaki, the reader can easily become obsessed with the truth of this story.

NOTES:
There are a lot of characters. Readers are cautioned to keep a list to track them.

I was so fascinated by Keigo Higashino when I read Devotion of Suspect X, I was pretty sure I read some of his other work. And few months back one of my colleague recommended me this book. When I look at book, the sheer size of the book make me skeptical, we are bound to be confused by the book which is heavy in weight I feel :P I felt I ll give it short for 50 pages and see how it goes, if I find it boring I will leave it after 50 pages. I was on second page murder occurred, 10 pages criminal investigation, 30 pages alibis, but no arrest by that time I was sure I would complete this book.

Journey under the midnight Sun is mixture of obsession, voyeurism, love, trust, betrayal and has been narrated so vividly. Just imagine all the parameters combined with mystery what would be the impact.

If I compare it with Devotion of suspect X, at its dark heart is just another tautly enigmatic relationship between a man and a woman. There are appalling acts, but our interest lies not in grisly details but in the ripples that undulate for years after. As one character notes towards the end: ""Two decades. Kazunari couldn't understand how something that happened so long ago in Osaka could be having such an effect on his personal life in the here and now."" At one crucial moment, this reverse ends up two decades before. As a storytelling technique, it is both disorienting and enticing. The reader is constantly kept on their toes and tantalized too. The effect is a little like the rudimentary games that Ryo pirates - mazes within mazes within mazes. All the characters play one game or another - whether they are on a computer, the golf course, card table, stock market or even the dance floor. These fictions within fictions and systems within systems create a hall of mirrors or statute of limitations that reflects the manipulations of Higashino's characters, whose plots rise and are submerged before our eyes. It will give you feeling like you are walking in a same wheel rut for twenty years. I quite like the term symbiotic relationship and analogy of Gobi and shrimp.

In terms of Japanese cuisine I found it quite insightful, starting from Miso Soup, ramen, sashimi, Tokyo areas, Osaka parts, mural art. It can be read it as a potted history of modern Japan - gender, class, money, obedience, an exploration of a crumbling social order, a ludic literary puzzle that plays with genre expectations

It could have been five stars rating but somehow I was taken aback as there were so many characters and not all have the link to the many story. For instance Yukhio’s mathematician tutor he just came to think how Yukhio only killed her mother with unnecessary background details. Also, there was no even single dialogue exchange between Yukhio and Ryo, no confession. When you will reach towards end you will able to figure out the reason for the murder and murderer and also even was there any accomplice.
One thing found it confusing or misread, how potassium cyanide and sulfuric acid acid turned into a gas and killed Imeada not Ryo ,how Rayo able to do this, that part I found bit mushy.

So, I would like to sign off with 4/5. This book will not let you down, will give you shrills, some will pump, adrenaline, some characters you will find the empathetic, some of the sub stories will leave you bewildered. If you have Devotion of Suspect X, you should give a try for certain. Remember it is not whodunit or whydunnit rather it what-exactly-is-being-dunnit",4,23 likes,8
review_2238165357,Addy,"Jan 02, 2018","I'm actually confused what to say about this novel. It is weird, disturbing but at the same time intriguing and definitely something which you won't put down too easily.
I already got some glimpses into the Japanese way of life thanks to reading 'Salvation of a Saint' & 'Devotion of Suspect X' by the same author but this one provides an even more in depth knowledge about their weird sense of love, humour, friendship and almost everything else. I know this is a pure work of fiction but it's such works of fiction only through which I was acquainted with so many different countries in different eras. Let me just say this, I would rather be in War torn Europe of the 20th century rather than modern day Japan. I was particularly shocked by what the school going teenagers did in the novel- would make our roadside romeos seem like Saints.

But then that also means that Keigo is one hell of an author who is making us see and feel the ugly side of things rather than painting just a rosy picture. Actually, no doubt about the author's brilliance after having read 3 of his works. There wasn't too much detective work involved in this one as such; it was more of a description of events over a period of 20 yrs and the obsession of a police detective to solve a seemingly unsolvable murder.

The climax was sudden and abrupt and left me wondering whether it was a happy ending or a sad one.

Many people won't like this novel at all while others will love it.
Go for it if you want something off beat, can tolerate Japanese idiosyncrasies and prefer emotionally charged thrillers rather than action packed ones(there's plenty of weird action though).

I have never been so obsessed with detective thriller novel like this (even though, Agatha Christie is my all time favorite). The plot made me so curious!..
1. An unsolved 20 year old murder.
2. A journey with the Victim’s son and Suspect’s daughter’s incidents & murders throughout the novel, from age 10 to 25-30.
And when I reached the climax (last 50 pages), I almost guessed the murderer. But the motive behind the murder gave me some kind of vibration/disturbance. a little bit and so realistic.
Yes, Its a Japanese novel (translated), I knew the character’s name would make some confusion. So I was like, “okay lets list out the names, find the connection/link and make a flow chart”.. ooze! Am I playing a detective role?! Yeah, kind of..
If you have seen any Korean detective thriller movies, then its quite an easy job to find the murderer & motive.

Lots of specific detail for Tokyo and Osaka and at freckle count description and detail too for dozens upon dozens of supporting characters.

Our detective continues seeking information about a 19 year old cold case and subsequent events of ""afterwards"" that relate strongly to it.

This is a difficult, difficult book to read in English. I can only compare it to a Stephen King equivalence for the exact minutia of trend, fad, present moment tidbits of ""now"" and not at all on the genre scale. In other words, you need to know very much of the cultural movements within Japan since the 1970's. Celebs, sports, toys, building busts and rises, bubbles for stocks- all of that etc. etc. etc. And if you don't? Then you try to swim through by context or by assumptions.

Therefore, as I can see how he is a popular author in his own country, I find it rather surprising that he has a following elsewhere. Because the length, the repetition, and mostly the very stilted and blunt translation tone! Well at times it seems that the people involved would be nearly obtuse or IQ challenged or something ""off"". And they certainly are not by the context plot and story. So how could you not notice so many things wrong with your own apartment and then just proceed to kill yourself by opening a toilet lid that you never close????

That kind of thing.

This would only be enthralling to those who are highly attached to 50 page detail per person. Underwear, choice of watch, kind of hair spray used- all included.

review_1408867854,Mithun Prasad,"Oct 05, 2015","To me Kiego Higashino is a like a fast food restaurateur, who serves clean and simple food, with no fancy cutleries, no assorted mix of garnished colored vegetables, no needless eating etiquette to follow. But what draws towards him recurrently when there is new plat du jour by this chef, is the irresistible and uncompromising taste of the dish served before and blind trust on the dish to be served. In the end that’s what matter, at least to me.

Writing being very plain and simple bereft of the grandeur that would incline him towards the crest of artistic merit, one who is unfamiliar with him would be hesitant to read his book. But like all his earlier books, once again it’s the mystery, the labyrinthine plot which is the cornerstone of this new book ‘Journey under the Midnight Sun.’

The books starts off with the murder of a man, father of the one of the protagonist Ryoji Kirihara in an abandoned building. With the investigation that follows headed by homicide detective Sagasaki, traces the final movement of victim before he met his fate. That leads him at the doorstep of Ms Fumiya, mother of another protagonist Yukiho. With the lack of evidence against most of the suspects and the sudden accidental death of the main suspect the police except for Sagasaki, were forced to conclude the case personally but officially the case remained unsolved.

But for next twenty years we follow the two protagonists, thorough their externally disconnected yet inexplicably intertwined lives as more vicious crimes continues to take place around them. Unlike other books Kiego relies on darker and morally questionable context to steer forward the relationship between them, and he does a brilliant job in planting spooky and uncanny picture of those two in the minds of the reader, especially Yukiho. Like his earlier book ‘Malice’, it’s not a typical whodunit, heck it’s not whodunit at all, but a mystical journey we cover along with the protagonists, except the journey is treaded in darkness under midnight sun with characters even darker than that.

The story spanning for twenty years goes on and on and after a certain while it tend to get a little tedious. Author uses his considerable knowledge of engineering background to weave some of his plot and mostly you careless about that. New characters are introduced right till the end and also with start of new chapter the story would leap forward to year or two to a new level of confusion and that will put you off especially when you think that they lived in harmony in between those years. Having said that even with its ignorable deficiencies and lagging behind just by a spitting distance with his earlier Detective Galileo series, it is still a profound book bound by two unforgettable characters ‘pistol shrimp and gobies’ with a brilliant and apt ending.

3.5 stars and 0.5 stars for the ending.

The character Yukiho reminded me of another character named Kanako, in the movie ‘The World of Kanako” from the Japanese director who gave a brilliant crime drama “Confessions.” Check it out if you haven’t.",4,9 likes,8

If I was willing to stay up late for two nights in a row, from evening until past midnight and last night (or morning considering it was 1 am and I stopped because the electricity was suddenly out.

review_4271006864,Lata,"Oct 19, 2021","I had rated Higoshino's 3 other novels (Devotion of suspect X, Malice, Salvation of a Saint) as 5*. I didn't know it was possible, but this one is better than those books.

This is a deeply disturbing book, and yet so compelling- the kind which stays with you long after finishing it. When I started reading it, I was expecting it be a typical Higashino book where we already know who the murderer is and this would be to uncover how the murder was done. But this one took me by surprise. The murder was just the beginning, the book slowly moves on to tell the story of the victim's son and the suspect's daughter in a span of 20 + years. However they never seem to be the focus of the story as this is told from the perspective of various minor characters. After new characters were introduced after every few chapters, i was wondering where it was going.
It started as a detective novel, with the police methodically quizzing every witness, verifying alibis. I got bored of the dry narration of who said what and frustrated at times when the police were too polite to ask some hard questions.
I didn't even realize when the narration took a complete new turn.

This book was full of my pet peeves- excessively long, plot seeming to go nowhere, multiple character perspectives, multiple timelines, inconsistent narrative style (sudden switch to non-linear narration), extremely dark and loose ends. But it was so engrossing, I forgot to be a book snob. This was so different. Though you have so many characters (that too, all belonging to a culture alien to me, with unfamiliar names) and the author never specifies the timeline, it was not confusing. The plot was quite complex, and the ending was speculative without any hard proof on what actually transpired.
The characterization was brilliant. I was scared for whoever crossed paths with Yukiho and Ryo.I admired Kazunari and detective Imaeda.
Through the 20 year span, we learn lots about Japanese culture, some technological details like ATM hacking, computer games piracy, AI etc.

In the beginning, I thought the timeline was concurrent (published in 2015) I was puzzled by the rush for toilet papers thinking the author had predicted the virus. But then realized this was in 1970 s and the shortage was because of the oil crisis 😀

One q to the author (this has been nagging me)-
Whoever carries a used pregnancy test strip in their wallet, just to remind them to be careful in future (and even shows it to their friends)!! Shouldn't they be carrying something else to avoid mishaps?",5,10 likes,8
review_2561399154,Yedhu,"Oct 27, 2018","Keigo Higashino is an acclaimed mystery novelist from Japan, and one of my favourite authors. He started writing novels in the 80's and was popular in Japan for quite some time. But the world came to know about him when his crime thriller, Yōgisha X no Kenshin, was translated to English as Devotion of Suspect X. He writes perfect crimes which are, indeed, page-turners.

Journey Under the Midnight Sun takes us through a time span of two decades. A murder is committed, and the specifics of it remains unresolved. Time goes by, life of everyone associated changes, but the tenacity of Sagasaki, the investigation officer, doesn't. He pays attention to the ramifications of the murder all these years, and continues his search for answers even after his retirement, which leads to interesting discovery about the past.

The intricate structure of the plot is purely mesmerising and shows the sheer brilliance of the storyteller. You come across these unanticipated subplots, with new characters and events, that just pops up and connect with the main storyline afterward. The ending of the book is kind of abrupt, but gives a logical closure to the crusade.

If you haven't read any books by Keigo Higashino, I would recommend reading Devotion of Suspect X first. I had trouble remembering all these Japanese character names. But that one didn't have many characters and it helped me to focus on the story instead of going back and forth to see who is who. This wouldn't be a problem if you have read Japanese novels before.",5,14 likes,8
review_1713402789,Calzean,"Dec 14, 2016","A clever book. Written like a serial, each chapter adds time, complexity, characters and depth to the story. The first chapter is quite slow, but the book picks up speed as the history and connections between Ryo and Yukiho is revealed and the old policeman Sasagaki attempts to obtain closure.
There is also subtlety in what the author reveals and the choice of information given to the reader.
There is also a sub-history of 20 years of Japan from the 1960s, baseball, pop culture and the early days of computing.",4,9 likes,8
review_2512266862,Mobyskine,"Sep 01, 2018","So amazingly written and structured well. The idea was great, the crimes and story telling were told nicely in each chapters though a bit complex but the nervousness really intrigued. I was amazed on how the author plotting each chapters with its own narrative and crime, but in the end it was all related. From a mysterious and unsolved death to missing people, friendship and most of it-- family. The plot fast forward to certain years ahead with lots of new characters and I thought I would get lost in remembering and collecting hints and puzzles or probably it gets too draggy in the middle but no, nothing of it! This was so perfectly written and probably the best Keigo's book I have ever read.

I love how Keigo described each of the characters, it was so detailed and dark, suspicious and strange that it gives me chills and suspense. How the crimes continue to occur in each chapter gives me a quite nerve-racking that I can't put this book down. It plays in a deep and unknown relationship of the two main characters and very psychological. I like how Sasagaki can't put the case down and keep on hunting about it until the end, and Kazunari one of my favorite character in here-- I was glad that he knows about Yukiho.

I never felt this satisfied reading a 500 pages book though I am a bit frustrated with the ending but I know it was the best.",5,8 likes,8
review_4530808977,Bella Azam,"May 23, 2022","5 stars. I will update my review when i recovered.

Edited: Short review before i really talk about the book in depth.


I LOVE THIS BOOK. THATS IT. DOT. NOKTAH.

If you asked me why, I probably won't come up with a proper words to say why. I just do. I think this is my favourite by him so far. I have read Devotion of Suspect X, Malice and Newcomer. All of these, I really really like but this book is just something else.

For one thing, the story is not some simple murder case alone, its more than that. Its the harrowing aftereffects directly came after the case. The case is what sets the whole event forward in a span of decade. My emotions went through many phases while reading this. To be honest, I'm not in my best state at the time i read this so it took me way longer to finish it. And when i finished it, the gaping hole that was already there in my heart becomes bigger and I cried. I cried for the tragedy, i cried for the person that i found myself attached to, i cried for that person whom seems to fall too deep and unable to crawl out. I cried for the what ifs, for the things that could be different, for the life taken away. I cried.

Plotwise
This book is long. Like really long for Higashino's standard but this does not deter my enjoyment of the book because the plot kept me interested throughout the book. The question that kept me intrigued is not whodunit because obviously by a quarter in, I knew who are the suspicious people involved but rather the whys that held my interest.
The story was structurally interesting, there are a lot of timeskips which can get confusing if you didnt follow the story properly. But this doesnt hinder my reading, its more of you knowing that the story happened in a span of decades from the time the murder happened to the present days.

Characters
Mind you, there are a LOT of characters involved but we solely followed 2 prominent characters, Ryo Kirihara and Yukiho Karasawa. However, we followed through other people's eyes/point of view, we never get glimpses of these 2 characters personally but mostly from the machinations and othet people's perspective. I really like Detective Sasagaki, the first character we see im the beginning of the book, he played a crucial narrator and we will see him a lot at the end although not the middle. When i first read this book, i never thought the story will goes as far as into these two characters from their elementary schoop age to their 30swhich is fascinating to read.

There are various elements to be learned from this book from computer programming/software, game development, the economic bubbles, the finance and scam, criminal activities, hierarchy, drugs and just so much more that i learned. I dont know how to summarize them but there are so many new informations that i learned here and they all tied into what happened in this book.

Its a shame this book doesnt get much recognition compared to his other books because i think its brilliant in execution. Rather than plot driven, its more of the character study that got me hooked and what came out from those tragedy and sinister event.

review_1981376780,Jane,"Apr 28, 2017","A gruesome murder of a pawnbroker, a dogged detective kick off this sprawling mystery that spans nearly twenty years and the lives of a whole cast of characters. This turns out to be more than a police procedural. Through various complicated subplots and unexpected twists, the author has given us a fascinating work. Various other murders occur throughout the work. It was interesting to see how the author drew everything together. I kept reading to see motivation. I was completely confused for about the first 40% of the novel at the Japanese names, but then things started to fall into place. It might be valuable for readers to keep some kind of name chart, along with who each character is. I enjoyed reading about snippets of Japanese customs and food. Dialogue was somewhat mechanical and clipped but the story moved along at a smart pace.",3,6 likes,8
review_2599712311,oshizu,"Jul 04, 2019","4.5 stars rounded up (compared with the Japanese edition which was a solid 5 stars).
There were 3-4 short scenes in this translation which seemed conspicuously crasser, cruder than what I remember of the Japanese novel, which I read 4-5 years ago.
I can't tell whether to attribute the difference to my faulty memory or to the English translation--that is, the artistic choices of the translation combined with the inherently more explicit nature of the English language. Most of the dialogue employed the Kansai dialect which, sadly, vanished in translation.
Still, a dark, twisted, perplexing, entertaining mystery.",5,8 likes,8
review_2017571767,Neer,"Jun 02, 2017","** spoiler alert ** SPOILER ALERT. Read it only if you have read the book.


""Some people walk forever in the sunlight, and some people have to walk through the darkest night their whole lives.... I've never lived in the sunlight....No, there never was a sun in the sky over me. It's always night....""

Excuse me, while I puke because these sob lines are spoken by one of the most sadistic, manipulative, cold-blooded b%*#s I have come across in books. The woman who uses men and then throws them over and who gets her female competitors raped really wants us to believe that she has had a hard life. This one doesn't spare even her friend. Why? Coz the friend one day turned smart and beautiful and started garning male attention. And, of course, our self-pitying female couldn't bear it, and so got her sexually molested by her pet-dog Ryo, who would go to any extent to satisfy her- murder, rape, betrayal. She even gets him to rape her underage step-daughter and if that wasn't enough, forces herself also upon the young girl.

And what is her rationale? Because she was sexually abused as a young child so, of course, everything is justified. Even killing her foster mother because the old lady was lingering on.

And Ryo? The boy who killed his father when he saw him sexually assaulting a young girl, in the end rapes a young girl himself.

Giving it two stars only because of my loyalty towards Higashino and because Kazunari was able to manfully resist Yukiho (Three cheers for him).

review_1866783125,Tenma,"Jan 05, 2017","""Journey under the midnight sun"" is undoubtedly Keigo Higashino's masterpiece. It is a far superior literary work than any of the POP detective fiction that he is known for. This novel traces the life of a boy and a girl over a span of 20 years, and the quest of one detective to link them to a series of unsolvable crimes. The structure of the novel and how it alternates between the characters is similar to Murakami's 1Q84 without the surreal elements. Although I am a huge Murakami fan, I enjoyed this novel much more than 1Q84 (which I also loved). To me, this says a lot for someone who is not particular about Higashino's work.",5,7 likes,8

從小不是推理小說迷，最近香港捲起一陣推理小說熱，把握機會讀完本土作家陳浩基的作品《1367》，這位被喻為香港東野圭吾的作家，其作品令我眼界為之大開。今次拿起東野圭吾本人其中一本被書評家喻為巔峰之作，讀罷簡直蹚目結舌，情節結構之嚴謹，帶領讀者從一旁觀察主角的一舉一動，墮進一個又一個精心設計的圈套，明知別有內情卻又無法理出箇中細節條理，那種被緊湊的橋段牽引的緊張心情，令我手執此書時欲罷不能。

review_2398969839,JakeR,"Aug 09, 2018","Genres of writing are different tools to question the world. Like science fiction is used to question the big concerns for future and the universe, detective novels are used to question humanity and psychology and society. Though of course science fiction can also be used to question humanity, which is I believe a big part of science fiction, however, detective novels are questioning humanity on quite a smaller scale, and I believe that is also more effective. For the questioning of humanity in science fiction has got to have something to do with the future, perhaps a crime related to a future technology, perhaps the madness the world sinks into at times of crisis. However, the detective novels are here and now, it is a question posed to the criminal inside every one of us. One might call it childish to read detective novels, but a detective novel writer really did his job, he should be providing to some degree, literature to this world.

Higashino's books, I would not say are too literary works, for most of his books, are of simple descriptions but a strong plot. However, I do believe this book contained both and was done very beautifully. Japan has lots of other famous detective novel writers, mostly a few decades ago, so written very elegantly and precisely and dramatically. But yet again, if we are to challenge humanity and display it to the people of the 21st century, I believe a language closer to our time will be more suitable. For it makes the sense of distance fade, and all that's left will be the true question of who we are, not just who some guy a century ago was like. Someone can write about a crime a century ago, but the impact that these detective novelists seek will not be found in the words of past, but in the language of the humans now. We have to challenge the criminal as not only an individual but also the individual's role in a society, and society changes, so, books will too, for writers gain inspirations from the world around them.

Higashino told a story of around twenty years, and in these twenty years, new technologies appeared, and new crime opportunities have risen, such as the illegal selling of video games. These crimes get bigger and bigger because it went from Space Invaders to Mario, and the reason for people's preferences in them is because of some ancient things in their genes: The attraction to colors, the desire to rid of boredom. All these parts of humanity are displayed with new technology, yet was not quite seen clearly, nobody saw how much they are helping crime, and even if they did, they didn't care, for people are as selfish as the criminals who sold them. As human. But what does that have to do with the modern society? Well, we are entering an age where pleasure dominates the truth. We are fed all these dizzying information that our minds overload and chooses to filter into the candies in the pile of vegetables, the pleasures, the things the bodies sees best. We are in an age of spin, of frenzy, of a time where criminals can easily manipulate the humans in people. They are the fishermen and we are the fish. I find it very funny that in a place like Japan, where it is very orderly and polite, such things can still happen on such a large scale. Though yet again, it is the age of spin, and heritage and traditions can be thrown out the window by the new generation for the new world. But the new world is very, very empty, and if one lives in the forever present at a time like this, who knows where one will be?
Like Christians seek for the bible, we should all seek for some knowledge in the world a little less crazy, a little clearer so that at last we will see the light of day, and not walk into the white night.


Do not go gentle into that good night

Do not go gentle into that good night,
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
Because their words had forked no lightning they
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

And you, my father, there on the sad height,
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Extremely touching, the 絆 between Yukiho and Ryouji. その人を絶対に守ると言う気持ち is quite common to see in Japanese novels, TV series, movies and so on. What I like the most about it is, everything is implied - 留白と言うものです. There is no direct expression of emotions, feelings or sensations. We are left to imagine and savor what the protagonists are experiencing in those dramatic moments. Throughout the novel there was no direct description of what has exactly happened to and between Yukiho and Ryouji, but that is indeed unnecessary :)

In addition I really like the narrative techniques of Keigo Higashino. The novel is divided into chapters and smaller sections, and usually there's a dominant, quasi-protagonist-ish character, from whose perspective a certain series of events are seen, usually spanning a few sections. It produces a fragmented view of the big picture, and the reader is expected to cobble up all small fragments together. It makes the reading experience a bit more active, rather than totally passive.

I am indeed deeply touched by this book.",5,0 likes,9

Thư đặc sệt tâm lí xã hội và là một xã hội thu nhỏ đích thực xuyên suốt truyện ta ta sẽ nhận ra những định kiến mà mọi người xung quanh áp đặt lên Naoki lớn dường nào Naoki buột phải bỏ trường học,công việc,ước mơ thậm chí cả người mình yêu chỉ vì cậu là em trai của kẻ giết người và như tấm gương phản chiếu người phải tự trả lời các câu hỏi kìa lại là độc giả chúng ta.
Ta cũng sẽ thấy rõ chuyển biện nội tâm phức tạp của Naoki về mọi thứ đặc biết là người anh trai

Với mình thư khá trọn vẹn đặc biệt về mặt cảm xúc và cả quá trình đọc cũng vậy để mô tả cho thích hợp thì ""Khác gì lấy con dao cùn cứa đi cứa lại vào cuốn tim đâu"" nó thật sự rất buồn và đau đấy
Một quyển sách không nên bỏ qua

Thư đọc chỉ thấy bi kịch từ đầu đến cuối, giáng một đòn vào cái lòng nhân đạo nửa mùa của con người. Lần đầu tiên tớ đọc cuốn thuần tâm lý như này của bác Keigo mà thấy hợp gu dễ sợ, thích hơn cả mấy tác phẩm trinh thám của bác nữa. Thích ở nội dung, ở cái cách viết câu chữ đơn giản mà vẫn khiến cho người đọc cảm thấy ngột ngạt, nặng nề, thậm chí tù túng cùng với nhân vật trong Thư.

Thư với câu chuyện bắt đầu bằng vụ trộm của Takashi, kẻ này sau đó bị bắt. Nhưng liệu có thể nào một phạm nhân đang ở trong tù lại có cách cầm tù luôn những người thân xung quanh của mình trong suốt 15 năm? Ấy thê mà Takashi lại cần mẫn làm được việc tưởng chừng bất khả thi ấy.

Chúng ta tin rằng chúng ta không có sự kỳ thị, nhưng khi bản thân gặp người có hoàn cảnh éo le như anh Naoki trong Thư - em trai của kẻ phạm tội- thì nhiều người lại chọn cách né xa Naoki dù rằng bản thân anh này không có lỗi gì, chỉ có cái mác “em trai kẻ giết người” duy nhất tồn tại và song hành với con người anh ta gần như cả cuộc đời. Sự kỳ thị ấy của xã hội không chỉ là một đòn giáng vào Naoki mà còn giáng vào gia đình, bạn bè và các mối quan hệ xã hội của Naoki sau này, khiến Naoki trở thành đơn độc lẻ loi, bất giác thành một thành phần của ngoài rìa cuộc sống.

Thư không chỉ nói về sự thống khổ mà còn cả sự tước đoạt, hoàn cảnh sống của Naoki mỗi ngày chỉ có bị tước đoạt hơn chứ không có tước đoạt nhất. Mà người tước đoạt đi cái quyền hoà nhập vào xã hội của Naoki lại chính là Takashi - người anh ruột và cũng là kẻ phạm tội giết người chứ chẳng phải ai khác.

Người ta cho rằng hình phạt thích đáng nhất của tên tội đồ chính là đằng sau song sắt, nhưng Takashi vẫn có cách để cầm tù từ xa những người vô tội 15 năm, từ người thân nhất cho đến cả những người không quen. Takashi hối cải nhưng đồng thời sự hối cải của anh ta đã chôn vùi cuộc đời người khác cùng với mình.

Keigo Higashino bằng lời văn dung dị đơn giản nhưng đã đánh thẳng vào tâm lý người đọc rằng hãy nhìn vào thực tế và tự đặt cho mình câu hỏi, tại sao xã hội lại kết án những con người vô tội như Naoki chỉ vì anh trai phạm tội giết người.

Chi tiết thích nhất với tớ trong này là ca khúc Imagine của John Lennon xuyên suốt cùng với chủ đề của Thư. Đọc xong rồi mà thông điệp vẫn cứ âm oang bên tai mãi: “Một thế giới không có phân biệt hay thành kiến, chỉ có thể là sản phẩm của trí tưởng tượng.” Với những ai là fan của bác Keigo, hoặc những bạn nào u mê thể loại tâm lý như tớ thì highly recommend cuốn này nhá, đọc kiểu đang mood 100 thành mood -100 luôn lol.",4,,11

เรื่องของพี่ชายที่ขโมยเงินเพื่อเอามาให้น้องได้มีเงินไปเรียนหนังสือ แต่ดันเกิดเหตุการณ์บางอย่างแล้วตัดสินใจผิดพลาด ฆ่าเจ้าของบ้านตาย พี่ชายติดคุก

ตัวน้องดำเนินชีวิตไปโดยมีตราบาปของพี่ตลอด แม้บางครั้งตัวเองจะไม่ได้นึกถึง แต่คนอื่นนึกถึงให้แทน เหมือนกับละครอะไรซักอย่างที่ตัวเองไม่ได้ทำแต่โดนตราหน้าไปตลอดเพราะเรื่องนี้ ไม่รู้ว่าเวอร์ไปไหม แต่ถามคนที่เคยอยู่ญี่ปุ่นเขาบอกว่ามันเป็นแบบนี้จริงๆ เป็นสังคมที่น่าหงุดหงิดจัง

ในตอนแรกๆ เราชอบการไม่ขยี้อย่างรุนแรงให้คนสงสารตัวน้องแบบสุดๆ แต่เป็นการเหยียบแล้วทรมานไปเรื่อยๆ ในระยะยาว ขณะตัวพี่ก็สำนึกผิด แต่ไม่รับรู้ถึงผลการกระทำของตัวเองที่มีกับน้อง ไม่ว่าตัวน้องจะไปที่ไหนก็โดนสังคมโทษตลอดเวลาแม้ตัวเขาจะไม่ได้ทำห่าอะไรเลยก็ตาม (เราควรโทษสังคมที่เป็นแบบนี้ไหม) จนมีจุดนึง มีคนออกมาบอกตัวน้องว่า เราทำอะไรไม่ได้ สังคมก็เลือกปฏิบัติแบบนี้แหละ อย่าโกรธสังคม คนที่ทำก็ไม่คิดอะไรว่าจะส่งผลถึงคนอื่น ดังนั้นก็สมควรแล้วที่คนจะเลือกปฎิบัติเพียงเพราะเขาเกี่ยวข้องกับคนทำความผิด เพราะนี่คือการส่งสัญญาณให้อาชญากรรู้ว่าการที่ตัวเองทำผิด มีผลทำให้คนเกี่ยวข้องต้องทุกข์ทรมานไปด้วย การมองแบบนี้ของคนรอบข้างไม่ผิด แล้วคนฆ่าตัวตายนี่ก็ผิดบาปมากๆ เพราะไม่คิดถึงคนอื่น บลาบลา โห เป็นการทำใจยอมรับปัญหาอีกรูปแบบนึงน่ะ ถ้าถามว่ามันเป็นวิธีจัดการที่ถูกต้องไหม เราก็ตอบไม่ถูกเหมือนกัน คงแล้วแต่ปัญหา แต่เรารู้สึกว่านี่มันเป็นสังคมที่กดดันตัวเองสุดๆ เผชิญความเครียดต้องจัดการกับตัวเองคนเดียว อย่าโทษคนอื่น โหว ไม่แปลกเลยถ้าแนวคิดนี้กลับทำให้คนเครียดมากขึ้น และส่งผลในด้านตรงข้ามนั่นคือทำให้คนฆ่าตัวตายมากขึ้นไปอีก

อ่านเล่มนี้จบแล้วจะไม่แปลกใจเลยถ้าคนญี่ปุ่นจะสนับสนุนโทษประหาร

จบการบ่น

ป.ล. ในฐานะที่อ่านของเคโงะเล่มนี้เล่มแรก เราว่าเขาเขียนสนุกดีนะ เพียงแต่พล็อตบางจุดที่มีเงื่อนไขมาจากสภาพสังคมเป็นสิ่งที่เรายังหงุดหงิดอยู่น่ะ

review_2031927517,nananatte,"Jun 17, 2017","จดหมายจากฆาตกร Tegami โดย ฮิงาชิโนะ เคโงะ

เล่ม ""จดหมายจากฆาตกร"" เป็นเล่มที่เราเกร็งจนไม่กล้าหยิบมาอ่านเลยค่ะ เพราะเคยอ่านรีวิวแล้วกลัวว่ามันต้องดราม่าจัดหนักชุดใหญ่ชนิดหนักอึ้งแน่ๆ ก็เพราะคิดเสียอย่างนี้ เลยไม่ได้ฤกษ์หยิบ ""จดหมายจากฆาตรกร"" ขึ้นมาอ่านเสียที จนตอนนี้พร้อมอ่านเรื่องหนักแล้ว เลยหยิบเล่มนี้ขึ้นมาเลยค่ะ

บอกก่อนเลยว่าเรื่องนี้ไม่ใช่สายสืบสวนสอบสวนฆาตกรรมนะคะ เป็นแนวสะท้อนสังคมมากกว่า

'จดหมายจากฆาตกร' เป็นเรื่องของชายหนุ่มคนหนึ่ง ที่พี่ชายเขาดันไปฆ่าคนตาย เขาจึงถูกสังคมตราหน้าเป็น 'น้องชายของฆาตกร' ไปโดยปริยาย ชีวิตนักเรียนม.ปลายเรียนดีคนนึงจึงต้องพลิกผันไป แต่หากไม่นับแม่ที่เสียชีวิตไป เขาก็มีพี่ชายเหลือเป็นญาติอยู่เพียงคนเดียว

ถามว่าดราม่ามากระดับปวดตับเลยไหม?
ตอบชัดว่า ""ไม่ค่ะ""
คุณเคโงะมีเล่มที่ดราม่าชนิดทำร้ายจิตใจคนอ่านหนักหน่วงกว่านี้มากมาย เช่น รักลวงตาย นิ้วสีแดง สมการเปื้อนเลือด ฯลฯ

ระดับความดราม่าในเล่มนี้ คือ ดราม่าจริง แต่มันไม่ทำร้ายจิตใจผู้อ่าน ซึ่งดราม่าระดับนี้เราว่ามันสมจริงและสมเหตุสมผลดีค่ะ

ตัวละครคุณน้องชายของฆาตกรดูเป็นคนธรรมดา เป็นมนุษย์ และเนื่องจากทั้งคุณน้องชายกับตัวฆาตกรเองต่างฝ่ายต่างก็เป็นคนจิตใจดีและใฝ่ดีทั้งคู่ เราก็เลยต้องร่วมลุ้นร่วมเอาใจช่วยพวกเค้าให้ผ่านความทุกข์ทรมานทางจิตใจทั้งมวลไปให้ได้มากกว่าเสียด้วยซ้ำค่ะ

ส่วนตัวคิดว่าคุณเคโงะเขียนเรื่องนี้ยังใจดีนะคะ มีตัวละครดีๆ ใจดีมากมายเลยค่ะ

อ่านแล้วนึกถึง ""น้ำพุ"" กับ ""The Reader"" อยู่กลายๆ เพราะมีจดหมายเป็นชิ้นส่วนสำคัญเหมือนกัน

แต่ ""จดหมายจากฆาตกร"" ให้บทเรียนในแง่ที่ไม่เคยได้รับจากที่ไหนมาก่อนค่ะ โดยเฉพาะเรื่องที่ว่าฆาตกรไม่ได้แค่ฆ่าคน แต่ฆ่าสมาชิกในครอบครัวของตัวเองทางสังคมด้วย ดังนั้น ในเมื่อคุณมีคนในครอบครัวเป็นฆาตกร คุณควรจะใช้ชีวิตอย่างไร

เราว่า ""จดหมายจากฆาตกร"" เป็นนิยายแนวให้กำลังใจคนสู้ชีวิตมากกว่านะคะ ให้สู้ต่อไปไม่ว่าจะตัวเองจะมีปมด้อยมากแค่ไหน ใจที่มองปมของตัวเองเป็นเรื่องสำคัญ และการก้าวผ่านมันให้ได้ ไม่ว่าจะด้วยวิธีใด หรือไม่ว่าสังคมจะมองเรายังไงก็ตาม เป็นเรื่องสำคัญกว่า

นานๆ ทีถึงจะเจอนิยาย/การ์ตูน/ซีรีย์ญี่ปุ่นว่าด้วยชนชั้นปากกัดตีนถีบในญี่ปุ่น ถึงไม่ใช่เรื่องแนวปกติที่คุณเคโงะเขียน แต่เราก็อ่านเพลินม้วนเดียวจบได้อยู่ดีค่ะ",4,10 likes,11

Cuốn sách mua tiki được giao đúng ngày sn. Và nó cũng là món quà giá trị nhất trong ngày sn mà được coi là buồn nhất đến nay!!
1 lần nữa sau cuốn Thánh giá rỗng, mr Keigo nhắc đến tù tội. Cuốn này, giống như 1 bản nhạc vậy. Bắt đầu từ nhẹ nhàng, đến sâu đậm và kết thúc đầy cảm xúc.
Đọc đến đâu, cảm giác người đọc sẽ bắt đầu tự hỏi: nếu mình trong trường hợp đó sẽ ra sao làm gì khi mà hàng xóm có anh trai giết người. Có cảm thông hay xa lánh. Thật sự khó mà trả lời được. Lòng người thật khó xác định, bản thân ta còn không biết ta như thế nào nữa. Như trong tình cảm vậy: bỏ thì thương mà vương thì tội. Cuộc sống mà.
Đọc cuốn này ấn tượng nhất với mình k hiểu sao là nhân vật nữ: ASami. “Là cô gái gan dạ và phóng khoáng, nhưng đôi lúc lại rất trẻ con. Mỗi khi nói chuyện với cô, “tôi” cảm thấy có gì đó ngủ quên trong tôi như được thức dậy”. Thật sự giống một người mà tôi thật sự không muốn mất.
Cuốn sách đáng đọc vào cuối năm!

เช่น การลงโทษคืออะไรกันแน่? ขอบเขตควรมีแค่ไหน? ญาติพี่น้องควรถูกลงโทษไปด้วยหรือ? โอโห้...นี่อย่างกับกฎหมายโบราณ ที่ประหารกันเจ็ดชั่วโคตร

เกือบทั้งเล่มเต็มไปด้วยการลงโทษคนที่ไม่ได้กระทำความผิด การให้อภัยและให้โอกาสอยู่ที่ไหน

โอเค...หนังสืออธิบายว่ามันเป็นการลงโทษจากสังคมโดยมุ่งผลไปยังผู้ทำกระทำผิด แต่มันยุติธรรมแล้วหรือกับคนที่ไม่ได้รู้เรื่องรู้ราวเลย โดยเฉพาะกับหลานสาวที่ตอนลุงทำความผิดยังไม่ลืมตาดูโลกด้วยซ้ำ พอเกิดมาก็ไม่มีเพื่อนซะแล้ว

ในขณะเดียวกันก็สามารถมองได้ว่า มันคือ ""อคติ"" ได้หรือไม่

การที่การเลือกปฏิบัติถูกมองว่าเป็นเรื่องปกติ ใครๆก็ทำกันแปลว่ามันถูกควรแล้วหรือ?

มีแต่คำถามแฮะ 55 ถ้าในแง่ของการดำเนินเรื่องยอมรับว่ามีเหตุการณ์ที่ดูจะเชื่อมต่อกันแบบแปลกๆและบังเอิญไปหน่อย แต่โดยรวมแล้วชอบมาก สนุกแบบดาร์คๆ มีประเด็นให้คิดเยอะ ดราม่าหนักๆแบบนี้เข้าทางเราเลย เป็นหนังสือที่จะอยู่ในใจเราไปอีกนาน",5,8 likes,11

""Anh ơi, tại sao chúng ta lại sinh ra trên đời này? Anh ơi, ngày mà chúng ta hạnh phúc liệu có đến được không? Ngày mà chúng ta có thể nói chuyện với nhau liệu có đến không?""


Phải nói như thế nào về Thư nhỉ. Mình nghĩ nếu không bao giờ đọc Thư sẽ là một sự đáng tiếc trong đời mình. Keigo lại một lần nữa kinh ngạc mình, đã đọc qua 4 tác phẩm của ông và chưa tác phẩm nào mình đánh giá dưới 3.75 sao.

Quyển sách này sẽ không có gì đáng nói nếu phần sau Keigo không bóp nghẹt trái tim người đọc. Hình ảnh cuối của Tsuyoshi cứ ám ảnh mình mãi còn lời bộc bạch của Naoki lại khiến tâm can mình nặng trĩu. Cái kết cảm xúc nhất của Keigo, tàn nhẫn hơn cả Phía sau Nghi can X. Mình đã quen với những tác phẩm trinh thám pha chút tâm lý xã hội của ông rồi nhưng chưa tác phẩm nào mạnh mẽ và gay gắt như Thư, vượt xa Bạch Dạ Hành.

Có thật sự một người từng có tiền án như Tsuyoshi chỉ cầm tù tại trại giam và cầm tù chính con người mình không. Không, họ còn có thể cầm tù cả những người thân của mình đến nhiều đời sau. Quyển sách như một đòn tâm lý đánh thẳng vào con người, con người có thật sự lên án nạn phân biệt đối xử hay đó chỉ là để thỏa mãn lòng ích kỉ của bản thân và để cảm thấy bản thân mình lương thiện. Nếu đặt họ vào trường hợp những người tiếp xúc với Naoki, liệu họ sẽ ứng xử như thế nào, giúp đỡ hay xa lánh?

Ở Thư, đọc giả sẽ không tìm thấy câu trả lời mà câu trả lời ở chính trong tâm chúng ta, giống như ở mục ""Cảm nhận"" ở cuối truyện, Thư là một tấm gương phản chiếu. Có thể mình không tìm thấy sự nổi bật và bất ngờ thường có ở Keigo trong nửa phần đầu nhưng 1/3 cuối đúng là tinh túy, đặc biệt là cái kết. Tạm gạt bỏ Keigo với những mẩu chuyện trinh thám sang một bên, đây sẽ là một quyển sách thuần tâm lý và u tối. Hồi đọc Điều Kỳ Diệu Của Tiệm Tạp Hóa Namiya mình đã bị chính tài lồng ghép yếu tố xã hội của Keigo thu hút, nhưng Thư lại còn ở một đẳng cấp khác.",4,5 likes,11

review_3761404618,Sơn Lương,"Jan 12, 2021","Những tác phẩm không phải trinh thám của Higashino Keigo lúc nào cũng đưa ra một thế lưỡng nan, rồi đào sâu nó thông qua tâm lý của tất cả các nhân vật có liên quan, và để cái vấn đề nan giải đó theo mãi người đọc, ngay cả khi đã gấp sách lại.

Với “Thư"", dù cũng là chuyện tội ác và trừng phạt, song chủ đề chính lại là sự kỳ thị, và cái thế lưỡng nan ở đây là ta phải làm gì, nếu bỗng dưng phải gánh chịu hệ quả của việc người thân phạm pháp và tù tội - cam chịu và cố gắng chứng tỏ mình là người sống ngay thẳng dù cho người thân có sai lầm gì đi nữa, hay đoạn tuyệt với người đó để không còn phải chịu miệng đời thị phi?

Hai anh em cha mẹ mất sớm, người anh chấp nhận dừng đường học hành, lao lực mưu sinh để lo cho em trai được vào đại học. Cảnh nghèo và áp lực đồng tiền đẩy người anh vào tù tội vì cướp của giết người. Trong tù, người anh đều đặn viết thư cho em mỗi tháng, cập nhật tình hình, động viên, mong tin em, trong khi bên ngoài cuộc sống, người em trở thành nạn nhân của kỳ thị, khốn khổ vì cái mác “em trai kẻ cướp của giết người"". Người em sẽ làm gì với thư của anh, hay đúng hơn là với người anh đã vì mình mà mắc sai lầm?

Keigo sẽ đưa người đọc đi từ trang thư này đến trang thư khác của người anh Tsuyoshi; từ nỗ lực xây đắp cuộc đời và mơ ước của người em Naoki, đến khi mọi thứ dần vụn vỡ. Những lá thư tràn đầy mong mỏi, gửi đến một người đau khổ với chuyện làm sao để xoá đi mối liên hệ máu mủ này.mNaoki vật lộn với thế lưỡng nan đó suốt từ khi còn là học sinh cấp 3 đến khi có một gia đình nhỏ của riêng mình.

Tsuyoshi đã viết trong một bức thư, ""Đời người chính là chuỗi tháng ngày phải liên tục chọn lựa sữa vứt bỏ và giữ lại”, nhưng dù đã thử qua mọi lựa chọn, nhưng cách có thể giải quyết vấn đề lại đòi hỏi sự tàn nhẫn, không với người này thì cũng với người kia.

Sợi chỉ đỏ của câu chuyện là bài hát Imagine của John Lennon, với những câu ""Imagine all the people living for today"" và ""And the world will be as one"" - những mong mỏi mà ta hiểu rõ không thể nào thành hiện thực.

Phơi hết tâm tư và hành động của những người liên quan, Higashino Keigo một lần nữa đặt người đọc vào chỗ phải suy nghĩ, nếu là mình thì sao? Hình như mình đã viết trong review một quyển nào đó, rằng Keigo cứ đặt người ta vào những tình huống không ai muốn xảy ra trong đời. Ở ngoài thì nói sao cũng được, đâu ai dám chắc khi mình là nhân vật chính của tấn bi kịch đó, quyết định liệu có dễ dàng?

Như một truyền thống không định trước, năm nào mình cũng mở hàng bằng một quyển của Keigo. Quyển này nặng tâm lý, nhưng đáng đọc.

หลายๆ ท่านคงจะมีความเห็นที่แตกต่างว่างานไหนของ Keigo คือเล่มที่ดีที่สุด แต่สำหรับผม “มนุษย์ตุ๊กตา” คือหนึ่งในนั้นอย่างไม่ต้องสงสัย อ่านแล้วอิ่มเอม และตื้นตัน

หนังสือเล่มนี้ไม่ใช่วรรณกรรมแนวสยองขวัญสั่นประสาทดังชื่อหรือหน้าปก แต่เป็นแนวดราม่าที่กินใจมากๆ มีส่วนของ sci-fi ที่มาร่วมผสมอย่างพอเหมาะลงตัว ไม่ไกลยุคสมัย และไม่เกินจินตนาการ

อ่านแล้วรู้สึกเหมือนเป็นการต่อสู้ของปัจเจกชนที่ชื่อ Higashino Keigo
เป็นการต่อสู้กับ ""ค่านิยม"" ของคนในสังคม และ ""กฎเกณฑ์"" เรื่องการบริจาคอวัยวะ และเป็นการต่อสู้ด้วยอาวุธทรงพลังที่ Keigo มีความถนัดและชำนาญมากที่สุด นั่นคืองานเขียน

หนังสือเล่มนี้เปิดเรื่องด้วยอุบัติเหตุของลูกสาววัยอนุบาล
สมองเสียหายรุนแรงเกินจะเยียวยา ผลลัพธ์ดีที่สุดคือเป็นเจ้าหญิงนิทรา
มันช่างบีบคั้นหัวใจเหลือเกิน กับความสูญเสียที่ไม่ว่าใครก็ยากที่จะรับมือได้
ทางเลือกหนึ่งคือบริจาคอวัยวะของลูกให้ผู้ที่รอรับ
แต่ทางเลือกที่พ่อแม่เลือก คือขอเพียงให้ลูกยังคงมีชีวิตอยู่
พยุงร่างกายไว้ด้วยเทคโนโลยีทางการแพทย์สุดล้ำ

แม้ว่าพ่อและแม่เลือกที่จะพยุงร่างกายของลูกสาวเอาไว้ ฟังดูแล้วคนอ่านอาจจะรู้สึก ""ขัดใจ"" แต่ขอบอกเลยว่า Keigo ได้ร่ายมนต์เขียนออกมาให้คุณ ""เข้าใจ"" มากกว่า นอกจากนี้เทคโนโลยีทางการแพทย์ที่เอามาใช้ก็ไม่ได้เว่อวังอลังการจนไกลเกินจินตนาการ
ทว่าการดำเนินชีวิตต่อกลับกลายเป็นอุปสรรค

Higashino Keigo ทำได้ยอดเยี่ยมมาก เพราะเล่าถึงเรื่องการบริจาคอวัยวะของผู้ที่สมองตายอย่างถึงแก่น
ลงลึกถึงสภาวะจิตใจของญาติ ที่ต้องเผชิญปัญหาทางมโนธรรมสำนึกว่าจะมอบอวัยวะให้ผู้อื่น หรือเก็บไว้กับร่างของคนที่ตัวเองรัก
และคำตอบของการตัดสินใจนั้น อันไหนผิด อันไหนถูก

เวทมนต์ของ Keigo ตรึงผู้อ่านเอาไว้กับประเด็นที่ละเอียดอ่อนและซับซ้อนอย่าง ""ชีวิตคืออะไร?” “ความตายคืออะไร?” ได้อย่างยอดเยี่ยม ทะลุทะลวงไปถึงก้นบึ้งของจิตใจจริงๆ จนถามใจตัวเองตลอดเวลาที่อ่านว่า ถ้าเป็นตัวเองจะทำอย่างไร

Higashino Keigo บรรจงสร้างคำถามให้กับผู้อ่านอย่างไม่มีอคติต่อบรรทัดฐานทางมโนธรรม จริยธรรมเรื่องการบริจาคอวัยวะ
และพิถีพิถันมากในการเล่าถึงเรื่อง “กระบวนการวินิจฉัยภาวะสมองตาย” ไปจนถึงประเด็นทางสังคม และค่านิยมที่เกี่ยวเนื่องตามมาของกระบวนการนั้น

อีกทั้งใส่ใจรายละเอียด นำความรู้สึกนึกคิดของทั้ง “ฝ่ายผู้ถูกขอ” และ “ฝ่ายผู้รอรับ”
ใช้ตัวอักษรที่ทรงพลัง ถ่ายทอดความรู้สึกนึกคิด และมุมมองออกมาให้ผู้อ่าน ตระหนักถึงปัญหาเรื่องความเชื่อ และค่านิยมของการบริจาคอวัยวะ และทิ้งพื้นที่นั้นเอาไว้ให้ผู้อ่านเป็นผู้ตัดสินเอาเอง

จบเรื่องได้อย่างสมบูรณ์ ซึ้ง และกินใจ

มั่นใจเลยว่าผู้เขียนทำการบ้านมาอย่างหนัก และผลลัพธ์ก็ออกมาดีมาก เพราะประเด็นเรื่องนี้เขียนออกมาได้เข้าใจง่าย ไม่บิดเบือน และไม่ตกหล่น

ขอปิดท้ายด้วยประเด็นที่ยอมรับเลยว่าอ่านแล้วน้ำตารื้น
นั่นคือความรักของแม่
อ่านจบแล้วคุณจะคิดถึงแม่ และไม่มีทางโกรธแม่ผู้เลือกที่จะรักษาร่างของลูกเอาไว้ได้ลง

ต้องขอบคุณ แพรวสำนักพิมพ์ และผู้แปล ที่เลือกงานชิ้นนี้มาแปล และทำออกมาได้อย่างยอดเยี่ยม ทั้งๆ ที่มีประเด็นทางเทคนิคของเรื่องการบริจาคอวัยวะเยอะมาก แต่แปลออกมาได้ไหลลื่น ไม่แปลกแปร่ง หรืออ่านแล้วสะดุดเลยแม้แต่น้อย

หนังสือเล่มนี้แนะนำเลยสำหรับแฟน Keigo คุณจะพลาดงานดราม่าชิ้นนี้ไม่ได้เป็นอันขาด
และแนะนำเลยสำหรับนักอ่านที่เป็นผู้ที่เกี่ยวข้องหรือสนใจเกี่ยวกับการปลูกถ่ายอวัยวะ ไม่ว่าจะเป็น ""ผู้ถูกขอ"" ""ผู้รอรับ"" หรือบุคลากรทางการแพทย์ เพราะนอกจากจะหาหนังสือแนวนี้ไม่ได้ง่ายๆ แล้ว หนังสือเล่มนี้จะมอบทั้ง empathy และ motivation ให้กับคุณ",5,17 likes,12
review_2334817338,ไม้ไต่คู้,"Mar 21, 2018","** spoiler alert ** หน้าปกเวอร์ชั่นไทยกับเรื่องย่อนี่ชวนให้เข้าใจผิดมากว่ามันจะเป็นแนวดาร์คโรคจิต แต่เอาจริงๆ แล้วไม่ใช่เลย ตัวละครหลักในเรื่องก็คือคนปกติธรรมดานี่แหละ ไม่ได้โรคจิตแต่ประการใด

ตัวเนื้อเรื่องมันเครียดและหนัก แต่พออ่านจบแล้วผมว่ามันฟีลกู๊ดมากเลย หนังสือพูดเรื่องความตายและการจากลาได้เศร้า แต่มันก็พูดถึงความรักได้งดงามไม่แพ้กัน

สิ่งที่ชอบในเรื่องนี้คือ Conflict ที่สร้างขึ้นมาได้อย่างชาญฉลาด ประเด็นการวินิจฉัยเรื่องสมองตาย มันเป็นประเด็นที่มีความลักลั่นย้อนแย้งในตัวเองสูงมาก และความลักลั่นย้อนแย้งนี้ก็ไปทำให้ตัวละครหลักตัดสินใจทำในสิ่งที่ดูจะเกินเลยจากสามัญสำนึกทั่วๆ ไป (หรือพูดแบบหยาบๆ ก็คือโรคจิต) ได้โดยที่คนอ่านยังรู้สึกเอาใจช่วย และเศร้าใจตามไปด้วยได้

โดยส่วนตัวรู้สึกว่าเรื่องย่อและคำโปรยเขียนออกมาได้เกินเลยไปหน่อย เพราะพออ่านจนจบแล้วเรารู้สึกว่าน้ำเสียงในเรื่องไม่ได้บอกว่าการกระทำของตัวละครหลักมันวิปลาสหรือโรคจิตอะไร ผู้เขียนไม่ได้ตัดสินว่านักเหตุผลนิยมหรือนักความรู้สึกนิยมเป็นฝ่ายถูก และไม่ได้ตัดสินว่าการกระทำของตัวเอกมันเกินเลยหรือไม่เกินเลย ไม่แม้แต่จะบอกว่าให้เลือกทางสายกลางเสียด้วยซ้ำ

เพราะงั้นไม่ว่าจะเป็นนักเหตุผลนิยมหรือนักความรู้สึกนิยม ก็สามารถอ่านได้อย่างสบายใจ เพราะจะไม่มีการยัดเยียดคำตอบอะไรหรือตัดสินอะไรให้ทั้งนั้น

เรื่องนี้ไม่มีบทสืบสวน, การคลี่คลายปริศนา หรือจุดหักมุมใดๆ ทั้งนั้น เรื่องดำเนินไปแบบเรื่อยๆ เนิบๆ เน้นไปที่อารมณ์ความรู้สึกของตัวละคร (และคนอ่าน) เป็นสำคัญ เรื่องราวมันดราม่าก็จริง แต่พออ่านจบแล้วกลับรู้สึกว่ามันอบอุ่น และไม่ใช่โศกนาฎกรรมเลย คิดว่าถ้าใครชอบแนวจดหมายจากฆาตรกรก็น่าจะชอบเรื่องนี้

review_2337932163,nananatte,"Sep 21, 2018","ก่อนอ่านก็หวั่นใจใช่น้อยค่ะ เพราะเกรงว่าเนื้อหาในเล่มจะวิปริตเกินขีดจำกัดที่เราอ่านได้รึเปล่า... แต่ด้วยความเชื่อมั่นในตัวคุณเคโงะมาก ยังไงเราก็จะอ่านค่ะ!

อ่านจบแล้วก็ไม่ได้น่ากลัวอย่างที่คิดนะคะ (คือเข้าใจผิดไปเองจากคำโปรยปก นึกว่ามันจะน่ากลัวระดับเดียวกับพวก ZOO ของโอตสึอิจิ)

ระหว่างอ่าน ""มนุษย์ตุ๊กตา"" รู้สึกเหมือนอย่างกับดูคนโต้วาทีสาดวาจาเผ็ดร้อนใส่กัน เพราะมันมีจุดที่คำจำกัดความของ ""ความตาย"" ในทางการแพทย์ กฎหมาย และปรัชญาไม่สอดคล้องกันอยู่

...ถ้าเป็นเรื่องเข้าใจง่ายแบบหัวใจหยุดเต้น ก็คงเข้าใจตรงกันง่ายไม่มีปัญหา
แต่ถ้าหัวใจยังเต้นอยู่ แต่สมองไม่ตอบสนองอีกแล้ว ยังจะถือว่าคนๆ นั้นมีชีวิตอยู่อีกไหม?

เราอาจคุ้นชินกับตัวละครสูงอายุนอนเป็นผัก หรือตัวละครวัยรุ่นวัยทำงานอยู่ในสภาพเจ้าหญิง-เจ้าชายนิทราตามหนัง/ละคร/นิยาย แต่ถ้าคนที่ตกอยู่ในสภาพนั้นคือเด็กน้อยคนหนึ่งล่ะ... เด็กน้อยคนนี้ที่เป็นลูกของคุณ

คุณเคโงะเปิดเรื่องโดยแนะนำสามีภรรยาฮาริมะ ทั้งคู่มีลูกด้วยกันสองคน เด็กหญิง 6 ขวบ และเด็กชาย 4 ขวบ
ฝั่งสามี - เป็นประธานบริษัทพัฒนาเทคโนโลยีจำพวกแขนกล ตาเทียม (ประมาณว่าถ้ามีผู้บกพร่องทางสายตา สวมแว่นตานี้แล้วจะช่วยให้หลบหลีกสิ่งกีดขวางในชีวิตประจำวันได้ดีขึ้น)
บริษัทของสามีพัฒนาอุปกรณ์ที่เชื่อมต่อกับสมองหรือไขสันหลังเข้ากับอวัยะเทียมเหล่านี้ เพื่อให้ผู้ทุพลภาพสามารถดำรงชีพวิตได้ง่ายและสะดวกสบายมากขึ้น

ฝั่งภรรยา - เป็นคนสวยและฉลาด อดีตเคยเป็นล่ามให้สามี ปัจจุบันดูแลลูกสองคนเต็มเวลา ส่วนหนึ่งเพราะอยากชดเชยเวลาให้ลูกแทนสามีที่วันๆ ทำแต่งาน ไม่เคยมีความเป็นพ่อเลย และเธอรู้ดีว่าเขามีคนอื่นหลังจากที่เธอกลายมาเป็นแม่บ้านเต็มตัว
ความสัมพันธ์เดินมาถึงจุดที่ทั้งคู่ตัดสินใจแยกทาง แต่แล้วลูกสาวก็ดันมาเกิดอุบัติเหตุจนกลายเป็นเจ้าหญิงนิทรา

""BMI...เบรนแมชชีนอินเตอร์เฟส หรือการเชื่อมสมองกับอุปกรณ์เทคโนโลยี ช่างเหมือนฝันอะไรแบบนี้ ต่อให้บาดเจ็บมายังไง แต่ขอแค่สมองยังทำงานอยู่ มนุษย์ก็ยังคงความเป็นคน และหาความสุขให้ชีวิตได้อยู่ ใช่ ขอแค่สมองยังทำงาน...""

เป็นความคิดของฝั่งสามี ทั้งเป็นความคิดในฐานะประธานบริษัทผู้มีวิสัยทัศน์ และเป็นความคิดของพ่อคนหนึ่งที่มีลูกสาวตัวน้อย(ที่เขาไม่เคยทำหน้าที่พ่อ) นอนหลับอยู่บนเตียงตลอดกาล


""มนุษย์ตุ๊กตา"" เล่มนี้จัดว่าอ่านไม่ง่ายค่ะ การอธิบายงานวิจัยกับความซับซ้อนของระบบการทำงานของสมองและไขสันหลัง เราไม่ถนัดชีวะเลยน่ะค่ะ แต่ยังจัดว่าอ่านเข้าใจง่ายกว่าเล่ม ""รักในโลกพิศวง"" เพราะเล่มนี้ ตัวละครหลักเป็นผู้ใช้งานงานวิจัย(คือเราไม่ต้องเข้าใจงานวิจัยก็อ่านรู้เรื่องได้) แต่เล่ม ""รักในโลกพิศวง"" ตัวละครหลักเป็นนักวิจัยเลย และเนื้อเรื่องเล่มนั้นเดินหน้าโดยเกี่ยวเนื่องกับงานวิจัย ดังนั้น... จะบอกว่า ""มนุษย์ตุ๊กตา"" อ่านยากไหม ...มันก็มีเล่มของคุณเคโงะที่อ่านยากกว่านี้น่ะค่ะ ดังนั้นจะบอกว่ายาก ก็ยังไม่ยากขนาดนั้นล่ะนะ

ประเด็นที่เล่นในเรื่องคือ ขั้วตรงข้ามระหว่างวิศวกรรมการแพทย์กับมโนธรรม-จริยธรรม

มันพูดไม่ได้เต็มปากหรอกว่าสิ่งที่สามีภรรยาฮาริมะทำมันขัดแย้งกับหลักจริยธรรมรึเปล่า อ่านๆ ไป ถึงจะรู้สึกเห็นใจและเข้าใจความยากที่ครอบครัวนี้ต้องเผชิญ แต่มันก็จะอิหลักอิเหลื่อใจไปพร้อมๆ กัน เพราะก็เห็นๆ อยู่ว่าทุกอย่างมันโอเคหมดตามความเป็นวิทยาศาสตร์ แต่ในแง่จิตใจ มันก็ส่งเสียงค้านอยู่เหมือนกันว่าที่ทำๆ อยู่นั้นไม่ผิดธรรมชาติมากไปหน่อยเหรอ...

ความเป็นพ่อเป็นแม่เป็นเรื่องที่เข้าใจได้ และก็เข้าใจได้ด้วยว่า ในเมื่อเกิดเหตุการณ์ที่รุนแรงขนาดนี้กับลูกตัวเอง มันไม่แปลกเลยที่คนเป็นพ่อแม่จะคว้าวิธีการรักษาใดๆ ก็ตามที่จะยื้อ รั้ง กอบกู้ชีวิตลูกตัวเองเอาไว้ พวกเขาก็แค่อยากเชื่อให้ปาฏิหาริย์เลือกมาปรากฎกับกรณีของลูกตัวเอง
แต่คุณแม่เรื่องนี้ก็สุดโต่งจริงๆ ค่ะ หลายซีนเลยนะคะที่คิดว่าผู้หญิงคนนี้เพี้ยนไปแล้วรึยัง

เราติดเล่มนี้มาอ่านระหว่างรอตรวจและรอสารพัดคิวที่โรงพยาบาลค่ะ เห็นคนไข้นอนเปลนั่งในรถเข็น มองดูใบหน้าของญาติผู้ป่วย ยิ่งช่วยทำให้เห็นใจครอบครัวฮาริมะไปกันใหญ่ค่ะ
เราคิดว่าเรื่องนี้คุณเคโงะก็ช่างกล้าเหลือเกิน แตะประเด็นสุดยอดแห่งความอ่อนไหว รู้สึกถึงความพยายามจะทำให้เรื่องซอฟท์ เพราะเรื่องนี้มีตัวละครแสนดีใจดีอยู่เยอะมาก เยอะกว่าทุกเรื่องที่เคยอ่านมา

เราชอบเรื่องของครอบครัวเอโตะที่แทรกขึ้นมา และการแสดงให้เห็นปัญหาของสภาวะขาดแคลนอวัยวะสำหรับผู้รอปลูกถ่ายอวัยวะ
เราชอบคำพูดของคุณเอโตะ นั่นน่าจะเป็นคำพูดเดียวที่จริงใจและอ่อนโยนที่สุดในเล่ม หลังเผชิญแต่ความเชี่ยวกราดทางอารมณ์อัดแน่นมาตลอดเรื่อง...

ไม่อาจเรียกงานเขียนของคุณเคโงะว่าเป็นแนวฟีลกู้ดได้ แต่อย่างน้อยเรื่องนี้ สุดท้าย ตัวละครทุกตัวก็ได้รับการคลี่คลายชนิดที่เราคิดว่าทุกคนได้พบกับความสุขค่ะ

ดูรูปหน้าปก อ่านคำโปรยตอนแรกนึกว่าจะเป็นแนวฆาตกรรมโรคจิต อ่านไปเรื่อยๆอ้าวไม่ใช่ละ เดาผิดสิ้นเชิง

เนื้อเรื่องคร่าวๆคือครอบครัวหนึ่งมีลูกสาวหกขวบ ลูกชายสี่ขวบ วันนึงลูกสาวจมน้ำ แพทย์สงสัยว่ามีภาวะสมองตาย แต่ทางครอบครัวไม่เข้าร่วมการทดสอบการวินิจฉัยสมองตายจึงไม่สามารถบริจาคอวัยวะได้ ทั้งคู่ตัดสินใจเลี้ยงดูลูกสาวในภาวะโคม่าต่อไปและมีการใช้เทคโนโลยีต่างๆเข้าช่วยเพื่อให้ลูกสาวสามารถมีชีวิตใกล้เคียงปกติให้มากที่สุด แม้จะมีความสงสัยจากทุกคนรอบข้างว่าจริงๆเด็กคนนี้ยังมีชีวิตจิตใจอยู่รึเปล่า การยื้อชีวิตไว้เป็นการทำเพื่อลูกสาวหรือเพื่อเยียวยาจิตใจพ่อแม่กันแน่

ประเด็นที่ชวนคิดในเรื่องนี้มีหลายอย่าง
- แท้จริงแล้วความตายคืออะไร สมองตาย?? หัวใจหยุดเต้น?? หรือการมีชีวิตโดยไม่อาจใช้ชีวิต?? ในเรื่องนี้เน้นเรื่องการปลูกถ่ายอวัยวะค่อนข้างมาก ซึ่งการวินิจฉัยภาวะสมองตายก็เป็นวิธีที่สร้างขึ้นเพื่อจะนำไปสู่การนำอวัยวะของผู้นั้นไปต่อชีวิตผู้อื่น แต่สมองตายไม่ได้หมายความว่าหัวใจหยุดเต้น เพราะมีระบบประสาทอัตโนมัติควบคุมการเต้นของหัวใจอยู่ แล้วญาติจะรับได้จริงๆเหรอว่าคนๆนี้ได้ตายไปแล้วจริงๆ
- การตัดสินใจไม่บริจาคอวัยวะเป็นความคิดที่เห็นแก่ตัวหรือไม่?? ทำไมถึงต้องบริจาคอวัยวะให้คนที่เราไม่รู้จัก??
- การตัดสินใจยื้อชีวิตของคนที่สมองตายแล้วจริงๆแล้วเป็นการทำเพื่อเค้าหรือเป็นการทำเพื่อเยียวยาตัวเอง การมีชีวิตอยู่โดยไม่อาจใช้ชีวิตจะเป็นสิ่งที่ปรารถนาหรือไม่

เรื่องนี้จบอย่าง happy ending การปล่อยวางได้ ไม่ยึดติด นำความสุขกลับมาสู่ทุกคน",5,,12
review_2533192482,Sơn Lương,"Sep 25, 2018","Chết não thì xem như đã chết, dẫu trái tim còn đập. Hay chết tim mới gọi là chết? Một lần nữa Keigo Higashino lại đưa người đọc vào tình huống mà họ không bao giờ mong có ngày mình sẽ phải trải qua: đưa ra quyết định cho câu hỏi trên. Nếu một người đã chết não, ta có quyết định ngưng điều trị, và xem người đó đã tử vong, hay vẫn duy trì sự sống cho người đó, chỉ để còn có thể trông thấy họ mỗi ngày, dù ngay cả hơi thở cũng phải nhờ máy hỗ trợ và họ sẽ không bao giờ có thể tỉnh dậy hay lấy lại nhận thức? Làm vậy là tốt cho người đang trong tình trạng đó, hay chỉ là thỏa mãn cái tôi của người còn sống?

Một câu hỏi khác, cha mẹ có nên đồng ý để con mình hiến tạng hay không? Đứa con máu thịt của mình qua đời đã là bi kịch, nhưng nếu giác mạc, tim, thận của em có thể cứu mạng người khác hoặc mang đến cho họ một cuộc sống mới, điều đó chẳng phải rất tốt đẹp hay sao? Nhưng nếu ta không hiến thì có đáng bị chỉ trích không, vì có những người phải chết vì không tìm được tạng để ghép?

Người ngoài cuộc thì dễ, có thể chia thành hai phe tranh luận kịch liệt, mỗi người một quan điểm và có luận cứ để bảo vệ suy nghĩ của mình. Nhưng nếu đó là con cái của chính mình thì sao? Ta sẽ phải quyết định thế nào? Ngôi nhà của người cá say ngủ là hành trình day dứt để trả lời câu hỏi đó của vợ chồng đã li thân Kazumasa và Kaoruko. Họ sẽ bắt đầu bằng lựa chọn nào, và sẽ giữ vững nó cho đến cuối cùng?

Mình đọc quyển này sau Thánh giá rỗng nên thấy có nhiều tương đồng. Cũng là nói chuyện một vấn đề xã hội, dưới nhiều góc độ, từ cá nhân mỗi người đến quan điểm xã hội và pháp lý. Xác định có nên ‘khai tử’ một người chỉ vì họ chết não mà tim còn đập cũng giống như có nên bỏ án tử hình hay không vậy. Đây là những vấn đề gây tranh cãi không phải vì nó vô lý, mà trái lại cả hai chiều quan điểm, cái nào cũng có cái lý riêng của nó cả. Thành ra có lẽ mãi mãi không tìm được câu trả lời làm vừa lòng tất cả.

Vì mình chủ trương nếu biết trước nội dung dù chỉ một tí cũng làm giảm cảm nhận khi đọc sách, nên review này mình nói chuyện loanh quanh, không nhắc gì đến nội dung. Đọc những quyển này của Keigo Higashino, nếu lược đi các phần đối thoại và backstory, cảm giác giống như một bài điều tra công phu, được viết khéo léo, đặt vấn đề và đưa độc giả đi đến tận cùng. Toàn bộ các quan điểm xung quanh chuyện hiến tạng hay “chết não có phải là chết không” sẽ được nhiều nhân vật khác nhau lên tiếng, và người đọc, có trong tay mọi luận điểm, sẽ là người tự đưa ra lập trường của mình. Có khi chính họ cũng sẽ hoang mang, vì thấy bên nào cũng có lý.

Quyển này mình thấy hay bị nhận xét là dài dòng nhưng mình thấy không có vấn đề gì. Nó gợi cho mình rất nhiều suy nghĩ vì gần đây cũng có nhiều câu chuyện xúc động về các em nhỏ hiến tạng khi qua đời. Mình nhớ câu chuyện bé Hải An hiến giác mạc và hình như bác Đặng Hoàng Giang cũng đưa các con đi đăng ký hiến tạng và chia sẻ lại câu chuyện đó như một lời kêu gọi. Mình đọc những bài báo về hiến tạng, một người chết đi nhưng cứu được nhiều người, đều xúc động, nhưng đọc Người cá say ngủ, mình mới hiểu rằng, đằng sau những quyết định cuối cùng đó là những đau đớn và trăn trở như thế nào. Mình cũng thích cách tác giả tìm hiểu kỹ lưỡng và trình bày các vấn đề về pháp lý, công nghệ rất rõ ràng.

Bộ sách Keigo của mình không cần phải xếp lịch đọc vì nó sẽ là cứu tinh mỗi lần mình chán đọc hay gặp một loạt quyển thất vọng, vì mình tin rằng sách của Keigo sẽ luôn cuốn hút, theo nghĩa cứ bắt mình đọc tiếp cho hết, chưa bàn đến hay dở. Vậy là mình đã đọc được ½ bộ sách của tác giả này, theo thứ tự mình đã mua. Nửa còn lại tính từ Ảo dạ cho đến 1 loạt (bị mọi người có vẻ chê) sau đó là Trước khi nhắm mắt, Trứng cúc cu, Ma nữ, mình cũng sẽ đọc theo thứ tự mua kể trên :)",4,,12
review_2214831461,Haiiro,"Dec 15, 2017","Vẫn là một tác phẩm rất có sự đầu tư tìm tòi và cũng rất có chiều sâu, cho dù có lẽ không làm thỏa lòng các fan trinh thám của Keigo. Tôi thì đã chấp nhận sự thật rằng nhà văn của chúng ta không chỉ viết trinh thám, lại thêm việc đã bỏ gánh nặng kì vọng xuống rồi, nên vẫn rất thấy Người cá say ngủ hay lắm.
Thêm lần nữa Keigo chọc thẳng vào một vấn đề nhạy cảm còn nhiều tranh cãi: chết não và chết tim, đâu mới là thời điểm con người thực sự kết thúc sự sống? Có thể nhiều người không quá quan tâm đến điều này sẽ chỉ đơn thuần suy nghĩ một lúc rồi chọn luôn A hoặc B giống như chọn một câu trả lời trong trắc nghiệm vui nào đó. Thực tế là với sự hình thành và phát triển các quy ước và quan niệm xã hội, giữa A và B đã tồn tại sự khúc mắc và có nhiều móc nối hơn chứ không chỉ đơn giản như những chữ cái độc lập trong bảng chữ cái kia. Điều mà Keigo đã làm chính là chọn một cách gần gũi dễ hiểu, từ từ dẫn dắt người đọc đào sâu suy nghĩ của bản thân; nhưng không hề ép uổng, bác sẽ vẫn để ta tự chọn đáp án cho mình.
Tai nạn của Mizuho đã gây nên những vết thương có thật cho người nhà em, cho ông bà, họ hàng, bố, em trai và đặc biệt nhất là Kaoruko - mẹ em. Vết thương thì đơn giản, thấy được thì kế hoạch chữa trị sẽ nhẹ nhàng hơn. Tiếc rằng sau khi vết thương khép miệng, sự TỒN TẠI về sau của em còn gây ra những chấn thương tâm lí, những bóng đen sâu hoắm trong tâm hồn họ mà tất nhiên nạn nhân số một vẫn là người mẹ Kaoruko khốn khổ này. Trong hành trình duy trì sự tồn tại cho con gái, Kaoruko phải đối mặt với vô vàn câu hỏi mà không có câu nào có thể dễ dàng đặt bút khoanh A hoặc B: Mizuho đã chết? Vậy cơ thể vẫn sống của con thì tính sao? Nhưng con không còn có thể có suy nghĩ được nữa, vậy phải chăng nên để con ra đi? Nếu để con ra đi thì người mẹ này có còn xứng với chữ mẹ? Nhưng nếu tiếp tục giữ con lại thế giới này liệu có phải là đang bắt con cùng bao đứa trẻ đang chờ được cứu vớt khác phải chịu đựng thêm?... Chỉ đọc thôi mà tôi cũng thấy quay cuồng cả đầu óc, huống chi là Kaoruko và gia đình của Mizuho - những người phải đối mặt trực tiếp và trăn trở suốt bấy nhiêu thời gian chăm sóc cho cơ thể đã mất chức năng của não bộ của em.
Thú thật, phần lớn thời gian đọc Ngôi nhà của người cá say ngủ tôi không hề thấy yêu thích Kaoruko. Tôi đồng ý với ông nội của Mizuho khi cho rằng cô chỉ đang cố chấp với niềm tin thiếu căn cứ của mình, chỉ đang lợi dụng cơ thể của Mizuho để thỏa mãn những cảm xúc và ước mong của bản thân. Có những khoảnh khắc thật sự là kì dị kinh khủng khiến hình ảnh cô ta trong mắt tôi càng được tô vẽ bằng sự ích kỉ. Có điều... Kaoruko cũng là người mẹ độc đáo. Sự ích kỉ của cô là xuất phát từ tình yêu bao la của một người mẹ, từ lòng mong mỏi hai chữ phép màu. Lòng dũng cảm của cô có thể khiến bất cứ ai cúi đầu, trong đó có tôi. Bởi vì ai ở đây có thể can đảm rút đi hơi thở của cái cơ thể còn đang hồng hào khỏe mạnh của con cái chúng ta? Nhưng rồi ai lại có thể duy trì nó trong tuyệt vọng khi biết rằng cái hình hài bé nhỏ kia sẽ không bao giờ có thể ngồi dậy cười nói hay cử động được nữa?
Và đây cũng là cái hay của nhân vật Kaoruko này - phiền phức nhưng thông cảm được thậm chí còn có phần đáng khâm phục; có cái tình của phần người nhưng có cả những toan tính vị kỷ của phần con, thực tế chứ không hề hình tượng hóa xa vời; có đáng ghét nhưng lại khiến người đọc yêu mến kẻ nhào nặn nên cô.
Ngôi nhà của người cá say ngủ đã có một cái kết tốt đẹp nhất có thể, trong sự cân bằng với thực tế. Nó giống như khi kết thúc một hành trình dài đầy giông bão, người ta được trở về với bình yên. Và cái cách kết thúc dẫu khá đơn giản và hiền vẫn khiến tôi nhận ra, truyện của Higashino Keigo luôn thật thần kỳ theo một cách nào đó.",4,,12

Khi chăm lo cho Mizuho, em có cảm giác mình đang bao bọc sinh mệnh do chính mình đã sinh ra, em hạnh phúc lắm. Người ngoài có thể thấy em là một bà mẹ tham lam nhưng mà…” Kaoruko nói vậy khi ngẩng đầu lên nhìn di ảnh. “Thế gian này có những thứ tham lam mấy cũng không thể bảo vệ nổi. Và tham lam vì con cái của mình thì chỉ có thể là người làm mẹ. Nếu Ikuto cũng thành ra như thế, em chắc chắn sẽ lại tham lam như vậy. Dẫu có vứt bỏ sinh mạng này em cũng sẽ bảo vệ cho bằng được.”

Nhắc đến văn học Nhật Bản, không ai là không biết đến Keigo, mà nổi tiếng như mấy tác phẩm Phía Sau Nghi Can X hay Bạch Dạ Hành thì mình lại chưa đọc, đây là tác phẩm đầu tiên mình đọc của Keigo. Tác phẩm nói đến một vấn đề mà đến nay vẫn còn mới mẻ ở Việt Nam: hiến tạng (mà lại là hiến tạng cho trẻ nhỏ). Mình không bàn đến khía cảnh nhân văn hay tính đúng sai của việc này như vấn đề mà các nhân vật đã phải đối mặt, mỗi người sẽ có một suy nghĩ riêng, nhưng với mình thì mình cảm thấy thật có ích ngay cả khi đã mất đi mình vẫn có thể đem lại niềm vui sống cho một người khác.

Cái còn đọng lại đến cuối cùng ở mình là tâm trạng day dứt, dằn vặt, đau đớn, cùng những câu hỏi của Kaoruko ở phần cuối sách. Không một ai trả lời được câu hỏi của cô.

Nhưng thôi, mỗi người có một cách lựa chọn và hành xử riêng, nhất là khi cách lựa chọn này dựa trên tình yêu thương thì ta không ở trong hoàn cảnh đó cũng không nên và không thể phán xét.

Thích nhất cái cách Keigo đặt vấn đề buộc người đọc phải thực sự nghiêm túc suy nghĩ, từ vấn đề có nên bãi bỏ tử hình ở trong Thánh giá rỗng cho đến vấn đề hiến tạng của trẻ em ở trong quyển này. Qua ngòi bút của Keigo, ta lại thấy có những vấn đề tưởng chừng như rạch ròi đó, nhưng ẩn sau nó lại nhiều vấn đề không tưởng khác.
Tuy nhiên, nói đi phải nói lại, ở quyển này Keigo có phần viết hơi lỏng tay, khi sự việc được đặt ra ở ngay phần đầu được kết nối với toàn bộ phần còn lại của truyện hơi hời hợt và rời rạc.

งานแนวดราม่าของเคโงะเล่มนี้ให้ความรู้สึกลุ่มลึกดีค่ะ ผู้เขียนเล่าเรื่องแบบตรงไปตรงมา แต่เล่นกับความหมายของความตายในหลายแง่มุม ไม่ว่าจะเป็นในมุมของวิทยาศาสตร์ การแพทย์ ในเชิงปรัชญา หรือในด้านอารมณ์ความรู้สึก และหัวใจรักที่ยิ่งใหญ่ของคนเป็นพ่อเป็นแม่ ในขณะเดียวกันก็ทิ้งความหมายของการมีชีวิตอยู่ไว้ให้เราได้ตีความต่อ

เราชอบการขยายวงความคิดจากพล็อตง่าย ๆ ที่กล่าวถึงพ่อแม่ที่ลูกสาววัยเข้าประถมเกิดจมน้ำแล้วไม่อาจฟื้นขึ้นมา พ่อแม่ได้พยายามทุกวิถีทางเพื่อจะยื้อชีวิตของลูกไว้ อะไรคือตาย อะไรคือการมีชีวิตอยู่ ตรงนี้ว่ายากแล้ว แต่การโยงเรื่องเข้ากับประเด็นการบริจาคอวัยวะก็ยิ่งน่าสนใจและหน่วงใจเข้าไปอีก เรียกว่าเล่นยาก เล่นลึก ไปพร้อมกัน

อ่านจบเรายกมือเป็นทีมแม่เต็มตัวเต็มหัวใจ รู้สึกประทับใจและคิดว่าผู้เขียนวางมุมมองของแม่ได้ตรงใจเรามาก ๆ ...

Câu hỏi chính trong sách là chết não có phải là chết không? Và thế nào là ""chết não""? Vì kể cả khi có thẩm định chết não thì cơ thể vẫn có thể duy trì một số chức năng nhất định với sự hỗ trợ của máy móc.
Người phương Tây thường cho chết não là chết trong khi phương Đông có xu hướng cho tim ngừng đập mới là chết.
Nói chung câu trả lời không dễ dàng và là một case thú vị liên quan tới nhiều vấn đề như đạo đức (hiến tạng bộ phận của trẻ con bị chết não). Về mặt cá nhân, mình coi chết não là chết nhưng không cho rằng bố mẹ có quyền hiến tạng con cái của họ.",3,3 likes,12

Mizuho rơi vào tình trạng nguy kịch sau một tai nạn đuối nước. Cô bé được chuẩn đoán chết não, và bố mẹ của cô bé được gợi ý về việc hiến tạng con gái mình, giữa rất nhiều băn khoăn và đau đớn, phải đấu tranh giữa việc từ bỏ con gái mình hay chấp nhận giữ lại cô bé với tình trạng có thể mãi mãi cũng không tỉnh dậy, bố mẹ của cô bé đã đưa ra một quyết định bất ngờ, và dự định ly hôn của hai người cũng tạm thời dừng lại.

Mạch truyện chậm rãi, có chút đơn giản, nhưng nếu như có thể kiên nhẫn đến trang cuối cùng, nó sẽ là một câu chuyện đáng đọc với mình là như thế, cảm giác như có thể trút ra một hơi thở nhẹ nhõm sau quá nhiều những uất ức khó chịu vậy.

“Vì con, dù phải làm những chuyện điên rồ nhất, hay bị cả thế giới quay lưng dè bỉu, mẹ cũng mỉm cười chấp nhận.”

Thật ra mình vẫn không biết liệu có nên nói người mẹ trong câu chuyện là một người ích kỉ hay không nữa, vì có lẽ bất cứ người mẹ nào gặp phải trường hợp đó, đều sẽ chọn cố chấp tin vào những điều bản thân họ muốn tin thôi. Giống như Kaoruko luôn tin rằng Mizuho vẫn còn sống, mặc kệ mọi điều thế gian xung quanh bàn tán.

Tình yêu của người mẹ, có chăng luôn lớn lao đến thế khiến người ta vừa ngưỡng mộ, lại vừa có chút xót xa.

Có vài đoạn mình gần như nín thở để đọc, bởi vì mọi thứ ùa đến bất ngờ quá, đến mình còn không thể tưởng tượng ra nhưng thậm chí có những đoạn vốn dĩ rất bình thường thôi, vậy mà vẫn làm mình thấy bứt rứt, giống như có gì đó đè nặng trong lòng.

Higashino Keigo vẫn rất thành công khi lại lần nữa mang đến một câu chuyện với những mối liên kết không ngờ, điểm khởi đầu cũng là điểm kết thúc, một cái kết bất ngờ vậy mà vẫn logic, không một kẽ hở nào xuất hiện, mình vẫn luôn cảm thấy Higashino Keigo thật sự quá tài năng.

“Thế gian này có những thứ tham lam mấy cũng không thể bảo vệ nổi. và tham lam vì con cái của mình thì chỉ có thể là người làm mẹ.”

Sau tất cả những chuyện đã trải qua, cuối cùng thì mọi người đều hạnh phúc, mọi gánh nặng cũng được buông bỏ. Cuộc đối thoại sau cùng ở bệnh viện của bác sĩ và người bố, thật sự đã làm mình thở ra một hơi nhẹ nhàng. Có lẽ với người bố, miễn là trái tim Mizuho còn đập, anh vẫn sẽ tin rằng con gái anh còn sống trên thế giới này.

Một câu chuyện với cái kết tốt đẹp.

“Người trao cho cậu sinh mạng đáng quý này đã được bao bọc bằng tình yêu thương sâu sắc, đượm hương hoa hồng, hẳn đã từng rất hạnh phúc.”

Có rất nhiều thứ, không phải là kéo dài vô nghĩa, mà là đang đợi đến thời điểm thích hợp, để từ bỏ, để tạm biệt và để dành cho một khởi đầu mới như những ngày tháng họ đã trải qua.",4,3 likes,12

Nếu kết luận cho thấy bệnh nhân đã chết não, pháp luật công nhận người đó đã chết, và cho dù lúc này gia đình có muốn hiện tạng nữa hay không, các đơn vị y tế sẽ ngay lập tức từ chối tiếp tục điều trị. Vậy là bệnh nhân chắc chắn sẽ chết – đúng nghĩa y học - ngay sau khi nhận kết quả chết não.
Câu hỏi xuyên suốt tác phẩm này không phải là cha mẹ nên làm gì với ""nội tạng"" cô bé. Câu hỏi là liệu họ đã tin cô bé đã chết hay chưa.
Nếu cha mẹ không tin tưởng hay chấp nhận rằng cô bé đã chết, đồng ý tiến hành bài kiểm tra không khác gì đang giết chết chính con gái của họ. Không ai, không người ngoài cuộc nào sẽ phải đối mặt với sự mất mát của con gái họ, và họ sẽ buộc phải sống với ý nghĩ đã giết cô bé cho đến hết đời. Bạn tưởng tượng được nỗi đau đó không?

*Bài viết dài dòng, kể lể lan man, không phải review sách thuần tuý.

Mình dốt y học và sợ bệnh viện. Kể cả những bệnh viện (hơi) vui vẻ như bệnh viện phụ sản. Không thể gạt đi hình ảnh nhơ nhớp và quá tải của các bệnh viện từng đặt chân vào. Nhưng cái cốt lõi hình thành nỗi sợ phải là cái mà bệnh viện chứa trong nó: bệnh.

Mình còn may mắn, sức khoẻ không thật tốt nhưng chưa phải nằm viện hoặc đi chăm bệnh cho ai. May mắn đó đem lại một sự thờ ơ mà mình kiên quyết bám lấy. Một cách để được yên ổn.

Dạo này đọc sách lại. Rồi cũng gặp những cuốn có câu chuyện liên quan đến y khoa. Vào một ngày không có gì đặc biệt, bật Goodreads, thấy Phương Anh chê Mãi đừng xa tôi (một cuốn mình thích) và bảo Ngôi nhà của người cá say ngủ hay hơn. Thế là mình bảo nhân tiện mai gặp nhau hãy mang cho tao mượn đi.

Ngôi nhà của người cá say ngủ, đọc mà buồn ngủ. Cuối cùng thì không quá mê cuốn này, nhưng kỳ lạ là nó lại khiến mình vô Youtube gõ ""Organ Donation Commercials"". Kết qủa là xem được vài phim kêu gọi rất hay.

Mình thích phim này: Even an asshole can save a life: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5y7f....

Phim này và bản Acoustic bài Help I'm Alive của Metric thiệt quá hay.
HOW TO ROCK A BUCKET LIST & SAVE A LIFE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EEgO...

Mình cũng coi qua một vài thuyết chống hiến tạng:

- Ba mẹ không đồng ý. Chết phải toàn thây.
- Các vụ mua bán nội tạng khắp nơi. Chuyện mổ cướp nội tạng kinh dị ở Trung Quốc.
- Các bác sĩ sẽ không cứu chữa bạn tận tình vì có mùi tiền ở đây. Họ sẽ phán bạn chết não rồi và. không qua khỏi đâu và họ sẽ ""thu hoạch"" rồi bán nội tạng của bạn cho những người giàu.
- Bác sĩ sẽ có lúc sai lầm. Có trường hợp bệnh nhân đã được xác nhận chết não nằm đó, nghe người thân của mình và bác sĩ đang bàn chuyện lấy nội tạng nhưng không đụng đậy gì được.
- Sợ. Dù lúc đó chết rồi nhưng vẫn thấy ghê ghê.
- Điềm gở. Tưởng tượng có một đống người đang ngồi mong mình chết để họ được sống. ""Không. Nội tạng này là của tôi. Tôi không muốn cho ai hết"".

Có thể còn nhiều nữa nhưng mình đã ngừng ở đó. Mình muốn nghe ý kiến chuyên gia: The Truth About Organ Donation (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILJri...).
Bác sĩ này nói một câu mình rất thích: ""Organ donation is not a mind thing, it is a heart thing"".

Một bác sĩ phẫu thuật khác thì nói thế này:

""As a believer myself and a transplant surgeon this is so far from the truth. Believe me when I say no one is harvesting organs for the money. In fact many times we have to reject an organ if it's not suitable to put in our recipient"".

Chắc là ông quên nghĩ tới những câu chuyện ở Trung Quốc. Nhưng cái mình thích là việc bác sĩ này tự gọi mình là một ""believer"". Từ đó thật đẹp.

Thằng bạn bác sĩ của mình thì nói: ""Quy trình ngặt nghèo lắm, khó chạy được. Các trường hợp hiến sau mất còn khó hơn. Lựa tạng cho cũng mệt lắm"".

Mình cũng chả phải tốt đẹp gì. Nhưng mình vẫn thường nhắc bản thân ""Focus on the good"". Mình tin vào những bác sĩ có tâm, những người đã dành cả thanh xuân để gắn mình với y nghiệp. Ai nói học bác sĩ vì mê tiền mặc kệ. Y là ngành hao tuổi trẻ nhất mà mình biết. Và mình tin bác sĩ phẫu thuật là những người chịu áp lực cao nhất. Đi vào sâu trong cái thể xác trần tục của con người. Là tìm cách chống đối cái chết trên từng millimet, là bất lực và quy phục cái chết, là những lần thừa nhận cái chết là sự lựa chọn tốt hơn.

Văn hoa thì nói vậy, nhưng cũng không it bác sĩ chẳng coi trọng cơ thể của bệnh nhân. Đừng nói đến những cái xác không hồn đem mổ lấy nội tạng. Nghe nói nhiều bệnh viện ở Việt Nam đã không nhận hiến xác nữa. Nhưng bên hiến tạng thì vẫn cần.

Khi còn sống bạn có thể hiến một quả thận, một phần của gan, một thuỳ của phổi.
Sau khi qua đời bạn có thể hiến mô - tạng cho người bệnh. Mô là giác mạc, da, xương, van tim, mạch máu. Tạng là tim, gan, phổi, thận, tuỵ, ruột… (Sau đó bạn có thể hiến xác cho y học thực hành).
Trong trường hợp lý tưởng, một người có thể cứu được 8-10 người. Mình chả hiến khi còn sống đâu. Nhưng qua đời rồi mới hiến thì mình làm được. Lúc đó còn so đo gì nữa. Ủa vì sao mấy con ma trong Harry Potter không siêu thoát hoặc biến vô mấy tấm hình nhỉ, ôi quên rồi.

Luật của Việt Nam quy định Hội đồng xác định chết não thuộc các chuyên khoa: Hồi sức cấp cứu, Thần kinh hoặc phẫu thuật thần kinh, giám định pháp y. Các bác sĩ thuộc chuyên ngành ghép tạng không được phép tham gia vào Hội đồng này. Cứ tin như vậy thì sẽ đỡ sợ cái thuyết ""thu hoạch đem bán"".

Đoạn này mình dẫn lại của một bạn tên Thảo Nguyên:

""Khi mình cho đi, thì tạng sẽ đến tay người cần, dù bằng cách này hay cách khác. Dù nguy cơ bị bán tạng là rất nhỏ, nhưng nếu nó có xảy ra đi nữa thì người mua cũng là người cần, vậy thôi. Còn về việc ai sẽ là người nhận, bệnh viện sẽ dựa trên danh sách chờ hiến tạng, theo các tiêu chuẩn sau:

1. Phải hợp. Hợp trong hiến tạng khó khăn hơn hợp trong hiến máu rất nhiều. Phải làm rất nhiều xét nghiệm để đảm bảo tạng ghép vào sẽ được cơ thể người nhận chấp nhận ở một mức độ nào đó, nếu không, sẽ không sử dụng được, phí một mớ tiền, phí tạng được hiến, thậm chí nguy hiểm tính mạng người nhận. Chưa kể, sau khi đã tìm được người nhận phù hợp, thì bệnh nhân cũng phải uống thuốc chống thải ghép nhiều năm sau đó. Vì hợp cách mấy, thì ADN cũng khác nhau, vẫn bị cơ thể coi là vật thể lạ, hệ miễn dịch sẽ tìm mọi cách loại bỏ. Nên là đừng hy vọng mình hiến tạng thì tạng sẽ đến được tay những người có hoàn cảnh khó khăn, còn phải xem có duyên hay không đã.

2. Trong danh sách những người hợp rồi, phải lựa xem ai là người ưu tiên ghép hơn, ví dụ như bệnh tình đang nguy cấp, không ghép sẽ nguy hiểm đến tính mạng, hoặc, đơn giản là gia đình đã có khả năng thanh toán cho ca mổ. Bệnh nhân nguy cấp hơn nhưng nếu gia đình không chi trả được, bệnh viện không có khả năng hỗ trợ chi phí, không tìm được nhà tài trợ thì cũng chịu. Cái này liên quan nhiều vấn đề, mình không muốn bàn sâu. Tuy nhiên, như đã nói ở trên, ví dụ ghép tạng rồi mà sau đó vẫn không có khả năng chi trả tiền thuốc chống thải ghép (theo mình biết thì tầm đâu 5 triệu/tháng) thì cũng như không. Nên là, người ta phải cân nhắc hiệu quả. Cũng giống như máu, một ca ghép tạng tốn rất nhiều chi phí không phải vì giá của tạng mà vì các chi phí sau: xét nghiệm, bảo quản qua nhiều công đoạn; nhân lực, vật tư trang thiết bị cho ca mổ; thuốc gây mê, hồi sức trong quá trình thực hiện,… ghép tạng rất phức tạp, một cọng chỉ khâu thôi cũng có thể mấy trăm ngàn, người ta xài mấy chục cọng là bình thường.""

Trong cuốn thông tin của bệnh viện Chợ Rẫy có ghi: Ngoài sự hoà hợp và vấn đề tiền nong, người nhận phải đủ sức khoẻ để chịu được ca mổ ghép và có thể đến trung tâm ghép kịp thời. Không có cái gọi là ngân hàng nội tạng như mình tưởng tượng (đã bảo mình dốt y học mà). Mình coi được một cảnh máy bay delay để chở ""trái tim đông lạnh"" từ Hà Nội đi Huế và phẫu thuật ngay trong đêm. Ông Giám đốc Trung tâm điều phối ghép tạng của nước mình nói là: ""Trong trường hợp bệnh nhân chết, từ lúc lấy tạng khỏi cơ thể đến khi ghép phải trong vòng 8 tiếng. Do đó, thời gian di chuyển, thời gian bảo quản tạng, các trường hợp phát sinh…. luôn được tính toán kỹ lưỡng nhất"".

""Dưới sự bảo quản của các dung dịch chuyên biệt cho từng loại tạng ở nhiệt độ 4 độ C, mỗi loại có thời gian bảo quản cho phép khác nhau. Thông thường, tạng được ghép trong khoảng thời gian như sau: 4-5h sau cắt tim, 6-8h sau cắt phổi, 10-12h sau cắt tụy tạng, 40-45h cho thận. Dung dịch chuyên biệt để bảo quản và nhiệt độ đóng vai trò vô cùng quan trọng vì nếu lấy ra ở nhiệt độ thường, tạng người sẽ hỏng dưới 1h"". Đó là lý do mà hiện nay (2018) chỉ mới có ngân hàng mô mà không có ngân hàng nội tạng.

Nói chung là quy trình thật gian nan, khó mà tin rằng mình đăng ký hiến tạng là sau này sẽ cứu được chục người như tờ rơi lý tưởng kia nói. Lại còn phụ thuộc vào việc mình chết như thế nào và nội tạng mình khoẻ mạnh tới đâu nữa. Mình bị xơ gan thì đâu có ghép gan cho người ta được. Nếu bị tai nạn mà tổn thương nhiều tới cơ thể thì có thể chỉ ghép được thận, giác mạc, xương, da thôi.

Còn một nguyên tắc để đảm bảo việc hiến tạng có thể xảy ra là người đăng ký hiến tạng sau khi qua đời phải cho người nhà biết. ""If nobody knows you are a donor, you are not a donor"".

Gia đình phải báo cho đơn vị điều phối ngay khi bác sĩ điều trị tiên lượng tử vong. Càng nhiều người biết càng tốt, lúc bối rối đó sẽ có người nhắc nhở và liên lạc với Đơn vị điều phối. Anh điều phối viên có giải thích với mình rằng: ""Lúc đó chúng tôi sẽ liên lạc với bệnh viện bạn đang điều trị để xem xét chuyển bạn về bệnh viện Chợ Rẫy hoặc nếu trong trường hợp tình trạng của bạn không thể chuyển đi được thì chúng tôi sẽ tổ chức đoàn phẫu thuật để nhận tạng tại địa phương sau khi được sự đồng ý của gia đình bạn cho phép chúng tôi thực hiện nguyện ước của bạn"".

Vài năm trước, Phương Anh đăng ký hiến tạng, hiến xác, hiến tóc, hiến đủ thứ, có khoe mình. Mình chỉ gật gù hời hợt. Rồi cái dạo be Hải An hiến giác mạc mọi người rần rần nhưng mình cũng thấy bình thường như bao chuyện khác trên đời vậy thôi. Giờ tự nhiên muốn đăng ký.

Ai ở TPHCM có thể làm như mình. Tải mẫu đơn về, xài ké máy in công ty, điền điền xong ký tên. Gửi cái đơn và một tấm hình tới dieuphoigheptangbvcr@gmail.com. ""Giờ không có ảnh thẻ, thôi khi nào có ảnh thẻ rồi làm"". Không cần ảnh thẻ luôn. Mình lấy tấm ảnh mình cười toe toét gửi đi mà người ta cũng chịu luôn. Đó, xong rồi.

Cuối cùng, mong là tụi mình bớt nghĩ về những cái tiêu cực xoay quanh việc hiến tạng. Ngoài kia có những người đang sống khoẻ mạnh mà đi hiến thận cho-người-lạ, và hoàn-toàn-ẩn-danh đó. Focus on the good.

Bởi có quá nhiều chi tiết mà tác giả đưa vào buộc ta phải hình dung đúng theo cách dẫn dắt của tác giả, thật sự là có chút không thoải mái, việc các nhân vật suy nghĩ quá nhiều hay giải thích quá nhiều cho từng lời ăn tiếng nói, từng đường đi nước bước cũng khá thử thách độ kiên nhẫn của mình 😅

Tuy vậy, ngòi bút tài năng đã thành công trong việc dẫn dắt đọc giả phải theo dõi và suy nghĩ ngay trong tình thế tiến thoái lưỡng nan của nhân vật. Dù mình đoán được kết cục thì vẫn không thể rời bỏ câu chuyện được. Một cảm giác tuyệt vời khi đọc xong quyển này là “TRỌN VẸN” 💚

Nút thắt được tạo nên bởi vấn đề luật pháp và sinh mạng, người ta cũng có rất nhiều lập luận trái chiều. Quan điểm của mình vẫn là “Không ai có quyền quyết định mạng sống của người khác, ngay cả chính con cái mình sinh ra”. Vì thế mình hoàn toàn đồng thuận với nhân vật chính, đó là bám lấy đến tia hy vọng cuối cùng. Thế nên càng nể phục lối tư duy, hành động của tác giả được thể hiện qua nhân vật.

review_2612797377,Sơn Lương,"Dec 15, 2018","Đó là một tối thứ 7 hiếm hoi mà mình biết rằng sẽ có chủ nhật trọn vẹn vào hôm sau, nên mình bèn đọc nốt 100 trang cuối của Ảo dạ. Kết thúc lúc 12h48, và dĩ nhiên mình không thể ngủ ngay sau đó. Giữa đêm mình ngồi nhớ lại tất cả những gì đã được biết về Shinkai Mifuyu về những chuyện cô đã làm, và mình thoáng rùng mình khi nhìn lại bìa sách một lần nữa.

Cho đến khi ngủ, mình mơ thấy Shinkai Mifuyu tìm cách hại mình, vì mình đã trót biết quá nhiều. Cũng đúng, vì như thói quen lâu nay, mình không bao giờ đọc lời giới thiệu ở bìa 4, sợ bị đóng khung suy nghĩ trước khi đọc. Tối ấy sau khi kết thúc quyển sách, mình mới đọc bìa 4 và thấy cái ý “mọi người tiếp cận Mifuyu đều gặp chuyện không may, những ai chạm đến quá khứ của cô đều mất tích” trong lời dẫn. Vậy là mình đã lỡ “động đến” cô gái bí ẩn luôn trong bóng đêm, mà lòng dạ, thủ đoạn thì ngút trời mất rồi. Thật khó để review sách của Keigo Higashino mà không nói nhiều về nội dung, nên các bạn cân nhắc trước khi đọc tiếp nhé.

Ảo dạ được xem là tác phẩm sinh đôi với Bạch dạ hành nhưng ngoài việc có một cặp nhân vật và người nữ nhiều thủ đoạn để đạt được cái mình muốn, thì có nhiều khác biệt. Dù Mifuyu chọn đứng trong bóng tối nhưng Keigo Higashino không giấu tham vọng, các âm mưu và thủ đoạn của cô với độc giả, trái lại dành rất nhiều đất để Mifuyu nêu lên “tuyên ngôn” của mình. Thông qua điều tra viên Kato, Higashino sensei cũng nhiều lần hệ thống lại quá trình, khiến câu chuyện dễ nắm bắt. Hệ thống các nhân vật cũng không quá nhiều, đến nỗi khó nhớ như Bạch dạ hành.

Như nhiều câu chuyện khác, Higashino sensei luôn làm như vô tình để các nhân vật nhắc đến một giai đoạn đáng chú ý nào đó, như một cách ngầm thông tin với người đọc bối cảnh của câu chuyện. Với Bạch dạ hành là thời điểm máy tính cá nhân bắt đầu phổ biến, với Điều kỳ diệu của tiệm tạp hóa Namiya là kỳ thế vận hội sắp diễn ra, còn Ảo dạ là thời điểm bong bóng kinh tế bị vỡ và nhân loại chuẩn bị bước vào thiên niên kỷ mới cùng nỗi sợ sự cố Y2K.

Câu chuyện bắt đầu bằng một bi kịch - một trận động đất kinh hoàng, khiến Masaya phải giết người và từ đó gắn đời mình với Mifuyu, người đã chứng kiến khoảnh khắc anh ra tay sát nhân. Mifuyu sẽ dẫn dắt Masaya cùng xây dựng kế hoạch tương lai mà cô đã vạch ra, sống “theo cách sinh tồn của riêng mình”. ""Chúng ta chỉ có thể đi trên con đường ở trong bóng tối. Dẫu cho bốn phía xung quanh sáng rực như ban ngày, cũng chỉ là ánh sáng không chân thực mà thôi"". Và từ đó hai người bắt đầu một mối quan hệ mà ""khi một người đau khổ, người còn lại sẽ có thể ở phía sau đưa tay giúp đỡ"" và “chỉ ở trong bóng đêm mới bộc lộ bản tính với người còn lại"". Hay chỉ là Masaya tin thế.

Không như câu chuyện cộng sinh kỳ lại của “tôm pháo-cá bống trắng” trong Bạch dạ hành, mà ở đó Ryoji coi mình là tôm pháo, có nhiệm vụ bảo vệ cá bống trắng Yukiho đến chết, mối quan hệ của Masaya và Mifuyu là kẻ thao túng và kẻ phục tùng. Nếu Ryoji xem việc bảo vệ Yuhiko là mục tiêu duy nhất của đời mình, thì Masaya tình nguyện làm “một tên đồng bọn trung thành” không phải vì muốn bảo vệ lớp mặt nạ của Mifuyu, mà “chỉ vì yêu, vì ‘hạnh phúc của hai người’ mà cô luôn nhắc đến, ngoài ra không có lý do nào khác.” Tất cả chỉ đổi đến đắng cay và cay đắng nhất là gen’ya - ảo dạ, những đêm tưởng là hạnh phúc trần đời nhưng hóa ra chỉ là hư ảo.

Và giống như nhiều quyển khác của Keigo, mỗi nhân vật đã xuất hiện thì chắc chắn sẽ có vai trò. Luôn sẽ có người làm nhiệu vụ connecting the dot - kết nối các điểm rời rạc với nhau để vén màn bí ẩn. Trong Ảo dạ, không chỉ điều tra viên Kato, là anh chàng Soga mà còn cả chính Masaya, người đã thề trung thành với Mifuyu và tin tưởng có thể cùng Mifuyu có được hạnh phúc, làm công việc đi tìm sự thật đằng sau những bí ẩn đó.

Mình ghét Masaya quá nhu nhược nhưng nghĩ lại rằng có phải vì Mifuyu quá đáng sợ? Masaya đáng thương hơn là trách vì bị nắm điểm yếu từ đầu và đã thực lòng mong có thể cùng Mifuyu đắp xây hạnh phúc. Nhân vật Shinkai Mifuyu được xây dựng tận cùng tàn ác, lạnh lùng, mưu mô, thường xuyên làm người đối diện “không rét mà run”. Mifuyu ""tuyệt đối không mềm lòng với bất cứ ai. Mặc cho người khác gặp phải bất hạnh thế nào, cô ta hoàn toàn không quan tâm"".

Cách xây dựng nhân vật quả thật để lại nhiều ấn tượng. Đến mức mình có lúc nghĩ giả thử có gặp một Shinkai Mifuyu trong đời thực, mình sẽ bị bùa mê đến mức nào và gục ngã trước cô ta ra sao? Nhưng điều mình cho rằng còn thiếu là lý do Mifuyu lại hành xử như vậy, dù đã có khát khao từ trước nhưng chẳng lẽ chỉ vì đeo đuổi tham vọng mà tán tận lương tâm đến vậy ư?",4,10 likes,13

Vầng ý là các bác chê thì chê chứ tôi vẫn thấy bác Keigo viết hay thấy mồ luôn đó. Không đọc thì thôi chứ cầm Ảo dạ lên rồi thì đọc liên tù tì một hơi không quan tâm đời cũng được. Phải cái tính ì của tôi hơi lớn nên dằng dai mãi mới xong được cuốn sách.

Nếu không bị ám thị trước đó rằng đây là tác phẩm sinh đôi với Bạch dạ hành - một tuyệt tác ra đời từ trước và đã tạo được ấn tượng quá bạo liệt sâu sắc trong lòng độc giả rồi, tôi tin là sự yêu thích của mọi người dành cho Ảo dạ sẽ đầy đặn hơn, bởi vì đây vẫn là một tác phẩm thực sự lôi cuốn và có chiều sâu. Tự nhiên thấy sự so sánh kia vô nghĩa và bất công quá.

Bởi lẽ xuất thân của Yukiho và Ryoji quá bi thảm, quá trình lại dài đằng đẵng với những tiết lộ nhỏ giọt, cảm xúc của tôi dễ dàng bùng nổ vào phút cuối khi tấn kịch hạ màn. Chuyện của Mifuyu và Mayasa thì lại không được như vậy khi mà Bạch dạ hành đã trao cho tôi những công cụ để nhận diện thủ pháp của Keigo ngay từ đầu, khiến mọi việc trở nên tỏ tường dễ đoán hơn. Phần chênh lệch cảm xúc đó hầu như là tất cả lí do vì sao tôi chấm Ảo dạ ít hơn 1* so với Bạch dạ hành.

Nôm na cho dễ hình dung thì biểu đồ cảm xúc của tôi đối với bộ đôi tác phẩm trông như thế này:



Có lẽ bị ảnh hưởng phần nào bởi tình cảm dành cho bác Keigo nên đây lại là một cuốn sách khác mà tôi yêu thích. Nhưng công bằng mà nói thì Ảo dạ vẫn có đủ những yếu tố để được xếp vào hàng hay mà chẳng cần đến sự thiên vị nào cả.

Giống như những tiêu chuẩn được đặt ra trong quá trình tịnh tiến của loài người, chân thiện mỹ dường như là đích đến của xã hội. Nhưng đó không phải là toàn cảnh bức tranh, khi mà người ta cũng tò mò và bị thu hút bởi những mặt tối. Người ta có thể chỉ trích thế giới quan loài người đảo lộn khi ai đó thừa nhận họ thích sự độc địa của nhân vật; đồng thời chính họ lại nhìn thấy một phần của mình bên trong những nhân vật như Mifuyu, tự hỏi không biết nếu bị dồn ép thì mặt tối của chính mình có thể trỗi dậy đến mức nào. Những nhân vật như Mifuyu rất có thể là đại diện của phần tối ẩn sâu trong mỗi con người, phần mà có khi bạn còn chẳng ý thức được nó có tồn tại cho đến khi gặp được dung môi thích hợp để nó xuất đầu lộ diện, tựa như trận động đất năm nào đã khiến Mifuyu quyết định rũ bỏ sạch sẽ mình của quá khứ để trở thành một con người khác hoàn toàn.

Vai trò của Masaya trong bối cảnh giả tưởng của tôi giống sự tồn tại của lương tri, trong thế cục nó đứng ở giữa trận giằng co khốc liệt của thiện và ác, mà thiện là phần người mà chân thiện mỹ hướng đến, còn ác đương nhiên là phần dục vọng hình thành từ đâu đó trong đời, là Mifuyu của hiện tại. Và kết cục thì đắng cay làm sao! Lúc nội tâm của Masaya thốt lên rằng Mifuyu - cô gái mà anh yêu đến khờ dại - lại chính là kẻ giết chết linh hồn mình, tôi cũng đến muốn nằm vật ra vì bị nỗi đau đớn quá chân thực của nhân vật xâm chiếm.

Cuối cùng thì Mifuyu, cả thật và giả, vẫn là một ẩn số đối với tất thảy mọi người, khiến cho cái kết của Ảo dạ thu về cả rổ chỉ trích. Nếu nói tôi không phải là một trong những người mong mỏi một sự minh bạch để thỏa mãn trí tò mò thì hẳn là nói điêu đi rồi, nhưng lạ thay đến cùng tôi lại chẳng thấy muốn đòi hỏi gì hơn ở điểm kết thúc. Vì đã mệt, có thể, hoặc vì thiên vị (một lần nữa), có lẽ. Sao cũng được. Dù thế nào tôi cũng đã thấy Ảo dạ đủ rồi.

Đọc xong cuốn này không thể không tự đặt ra câu hỏi, không biết Keigo-sensei có thù hằn gì với phụ nữ không nữa :))",4,19 likes,13

Nên tính ra là hoàn toàn có lý khi người ta cứ so sánh 2 tác phẩm này với nhau, vì mình đâu có biết trước thông tin này đâu mà vẫn cứ so sánh nè.
Cách xây dựng câu chuyện, nhân vật, và những cú twist chóng mặt của Keigo vốn là những điều tuyệt vời mà mình yêu thích ở tác giả rồi. Nhưng đọc Ảo dạ không có cảm giác đã bằng, vì như mình nói ở trên đó, nó khá giống Bạch Dạ Hành. Ok nếu phân tích kỹ càng thì đương nhiên có rất nhiều điểm khác biệt, nhưng mạch truyện chính để xây dựng tình tiết thì khá giống nhau, đó là mối quan hệ mật thiết giữa 2 nhân vật chính 1 nam 1 nữ và hành trình bí ẩn đầy tội ác của họ.

Háo hức đi mua, háo hức chụp ảnh, háo hức đọc và kết thúc mới thật là...!

Cuốn này dễ đoán vì Keigo cũng không cố tình giấu điều gì. Nhưng là 1 fan của ông, mình hơi thất vọng vì mọi cuốn khác đều đọng lại một dạng cảm xúc: trăn trở hoặc chiêm nghiệm nào đó, nếu không thì cũng đầy bất ngờ... nhưng cuốn này chẳng mang lại những cảm xúc ấy. Nó chỉ là một câu chuyện, cách kể thì vẫn hấp dẫn nhưng kết thúc thì trống rỗng.

Cuốn này thấy thương kẻ giết người. Keigo nhìn chung có vẻ sợ yêu và sợ gái đẹp 😷

Vì yêu bác này nên thôi không chấm điểm.

Spoil nhẹ từ đoạn này:

Kết cấu hơi giống bạch dạ hành: đều xảy ra một sự việc động trời kết nối 2 nhân vật chính, nhưng khác là nam chính trong BDH hành động như một cách trả nợ, còn cuốn này chủ yếu lại vì tình yêu. Nữ chính 2 truyện đều là hồ ly tinh cả, thông minh và tàn nhẫn ngang nhau. Nhưng sự thông minh và tàn nhẫn của Yukiho được biểu hiện ở level cao hơn.

Độ sâu sắc thì BDH cao hơn nhiều còn Ảo dạ kết thúc gây ức chế hơn vì động cơ cuối cùng và những nguyên nhân đẩy vai chính tới tâm lý méo mó vẫn là ẩn số (ý mình là không thực rõ ràng như BDH). Một số cái chưa rõ ở BDH thì có thể giải thích được khi đọc cuốn này.",3,,13

Cá nhân tui thì Ảo dạ vẫn có nét đặc sắc riêng. Twist được rải đều, dễ nắm bắt mạch truyện, trang trước thắt nút thì có khi lật tiếp mấy trang sau nút đã được mở rồi. Chỉ có cái twist ghê rợn nhất thì ém tới gần cuối mới bung. Mà đọc xong đoạn đó tui phải công nhận Mifuyu là một con quỷ thiệt sự. Quá tàn khốc. Thực sự quá tàn khốc.
Truyện cũng có cái hay là, phần giới thiệu và cả chương đầu của truyện sẽ khiến bạn nhầm tưởng Mifuyu là người con gái đứng trong bóng đêm giúp che giấu quá khứ bí mật của nam chính Masaya. Mà thật ra (spoil tẹo) là vai trò hoán đổi đó quý dị, Mifuyu đứng dưới ánh sáng thoả sức hưởng thụ còn Masaya mới là người phải lầm lũi bước trong bóng tối. Và cả câu truyện là một quả lừa choáng váng, Mifuyu lừa tất cả mọi người ko sót một ai, đọc mà xót anh Masaya quá chừng luôn 😰.
Đọc xong Ảo dạ tui mới thấy Yukiho yêu đương thật lòng hơn mẹ Mifuyu này nhiều, Mifuyu giống như một con búp bê rỗng ruột, vô hồn, lạnh lẽo tới rùng mình.
Lại nói vụ bìa thể hiện đúng tinh thần sách thật ấy 😂 mà hồi vote bìa các bạn cứ bảo bìa ko có bàn tay nhìn trống trải các thứ, cuối cùng đọc xong truyện tui mới thấy đáng lí mọi người nên vote bìa ko có bàn tay 😂 nhìn thừa dễ sợ luôn :))).",4,,13

Đến tận phút cuối, cũng không ai biết được Shinkai Mifuyu có phải là kẻ giả mạo không, hay chính là cô gái có cha mẹ ra đi trong cơn động đất ấy. Cô ta đã sống một cuộc đời mới tái sinh sau cơn địa chấn kinh hoàng, từng bước leo lên những địa vị cao hơn trong xã hội, bằng nhan sắc của mình cũng như dẫm đạp lên biết bao người khác.

Thật sự kẻ đáng trách nhất toàn bộ chính là Masaya. Chỉ vì một khoảnh khắc đầu tiên khi 2 người gặp nhau, anh đã buộc mình gắn bó sống chết với Mifuyu, để cô ta mặc sức điều khiển anh làm những việc trái với đạo đức bản thân mình. Bên cô ta, anh cảm thấy mình như đã bị giết chết linh hồn, nhưng vẫn yêu cô ta đến điên dại. Để rồi dẫn đến một cái kết thật đớn đau..

Đọc rì viu mới thấy mọi người so sánh với Bạch Dạ Hành nhiều ghê. Kể cả có là song sanh với nhau đi nữa thì mỗi đứa đều bánh cuốn theo cách riêng rất riêng của nó. Nếu đem lên bàn cân so sánh thì thật là bất công cho Ảo dạ, vì xét tổng thể, đây là một tiểu thuyết trinh thám với những cú twist chóng mặt, sự hợp nhất giữa các tình tiết mà không có một chút dư thừa. Mình bị hút vào đêm ảo ảnh đó mãi không muốn dứt, đôi khi muốn nôn ọe theo Masaya vì tưởng tượng cảnh gây án cùng mùi tanh nồng của máu 🥶 Đấy, hấp dẫn thế này cơ mà! Nhưng người anh em Bạch Dạ Hành sinh ra trước đó lại quá đỗi ấn tượng và xuất sắc, nên Ảo dạ bị lép vế, kể cũng tội.

Vẫn là Keigo sensei với chuỗi nhân vật chính khiến người đọc cảm thấy mất niềm tin vào phụ nữ :((( Mifuyu ác chi mà ác kinh khủng khiếp, ác một mình đi chứ ác vậy ai thèm chơi. Nếu Yukiho 9 thì bà này ăn chắc điểm 10 luôn.

Thiệt lòng mình đã mong chờ một cái kết hả hê, với phần thắng nghiêng về phe Sự Thật. Nhưng oh no, kẻ độc ác kia thời tới cản không kịp luôn rồi, nghĩ mà tứk 😤 rốt cuộc mọi thứ diễn ra cũng chỉ là ảo ảnh, tình yêu ảo ảnh, sắc đẹp ảo ảnh, sự thật cũng có phần nào đó bị méo mó và out nét.

review_2384395262,Linhi,"May 07, 2018","Ảo Dạ được gọi là chị em song sinh với Bạch Dạ Hành, nhưng tôi thấy so với Bạch Dạ Hành thì Ảo Dạ giống như nho còn xanh. Kiểu như Thúy Vân thì cũng đẹp đấy, nhưng chưa gọi là nghiêng nước nghiêng thành để đóng vai chính là Thúy Kiều :-P

Cả hai bộ Bạch Dạ Hành và Ảo Dạ đều viết về lòng dạ đàn bà, nữ chính đều đáng sợ. Nhưng Yukiho của Bạch Dạ Hành đặc sắc hơn nhiều.

Tôi thích Yukiho hơn. Mặc dù đóng vai ác nhưng tôi vẫn cảm thấy cô ấy lấp lánh thoát tục thu hút; như vì sao xa, dẫu người ta biết là không với tới được nhưng vẫn tình nguyện ‘hồn này chìm vào đôi mắt em’. Chính vì tạo hình nữ chính xuất sắc như vậy, nên nam chính Ryoji dẫu có làm gì thì người đọc cũng quy về *đáng để đánh đổi*.

Còn Mifuyu, đến khi biết cổ giết chết linh hồn của người đồng hành là tôi thấy cái ác của cổ quá tội lỗi. Vốn không có cảm tình với nữ chính, nên Masaya vì yêu mà chết tôi thấy…. đáng đời. Nói chung là không thích mấy người yêu đến mất đi lý trí, sự thật 'nó chả yêu mình' rành rành ra đấy mà còn mê muội ;-))
Số phận quả thật tùy thuộc rất nhiều vào sự lựa chọn, phải chi Masaya chọn một người tương đối phù hợp với mình (ở đây là nữ phụ) thì đã có thể trọn kiếp bình an rồi. Thôi, ngu thì chết chứ bệnh tật gì!

Có một chi tiết được xây dựng không hợp logic lắm, là Mifuyu giúp đỡ vợ của người bị hại. Đến Masaya đã trao cổ cả linh hồn mà mà cô ấy còn nhẫn tâm giết, người đã như vậy thì còn biết cảm thông với ai nữa cơ chứ.",4,2 likes,13

Ảo dạ là cuốn thứ 5 mình đọc của Keigo Higashino. Phải nói rằng nếu nói về việc chán văn phong của Keigo thì mình hoàn toàn chưa hề chán, vẫn là những phút hồi hộp tò mò liên túc, vẫn là cái cảm giác thôi thúc lật dở từng trang sách tiếp theo để đi đến tận cùng của cuốn sách. Cách dẫn dắt người đọc của Keigo Higashino theo mình là vẫn luôn rất tuyệt vời.

Có điều với Ảo dạ thì cốt truyện không làm mình xuýt xoa như ngày trước đọc Bạch Dạ Hành. Với những ai nghiền Bạch Dạ Hành (như mình) thì đọc Ảo dạ sẽ liên tưởng đến rất nhiều đến nó ( dù mình đọc Bạch Dạ Hành cách đây đã rất lâu). Vẫn là một cặp đôi nam nữ song hành, vẫn là một người ngoài sáng một người trong tối. Có điều cái mình không thích ở Ảo Dạ chính là tác giả không phơi bày, không lí giải một Mifuyu đa đoan quỷ kế như vậy là từ đâu vì sao vì cái gì như cái cách để người ta hiểu và thương như đã từng với Yukiho. Và vì thương và hiểu Yukiho người ta mới dễ lí giải hơn tâm lý của Ryoji hơn là hiểu Masaya.

Khác với Bạch Dạ Hành thì cặp nv chính trong truyện này không có tí đáng thương nào, đặc biệt là nam chính. Vừa ngu, vừa hèn, vừa sĩ diện ảo tưởng đến kinh ngạc.

Nữ chính thì hành động cực kỳ hãm. Được xây dựng là nột người có thể dùng sắc định thiên hạ nhưng đọc vào chỉ thấy một con hâm dở tự ti về bản thân, chứ không có sự tự tin của một người đàn bà bản lĩnh. Đọc đến cuối vẫn không hiểu lý do mà nữ chính dốc hết tâm sức quyết đạp lên xh để đổi đời là gì. Tác giả so sánh nữ chính với Scarlett trong Cuốn Theo Chiều Gió nhưng mình thấy ngoài độ

Nếu như trong Bạch Dạ Hành, mình éo thương được Yukiho mặc dù cũng chừa một phần xíu xiu thương cảm, thì trong Ảo Dạ, mình ghét Mifuyu từ đầu đến cuối không cảm thông được một xen ti mét nào. Mình ghét luôn cả cái bọn đàn ông thấy gái đẹp là IQ tự động tụt về không.

review_4061839566,Nguyet Minh,"Jun 20, 2021","Lại một kết thúc mở cho một tác phẩm của Higashino Keigo. Mình tự nhủ thầm “liệu sự trả giá cho những tội ác thản nhiên đến không tưởng có tồn tại không? Và nếu có, nó sẽ tồn tại dưới những hình thức nào? Là pháp lý hay những dằn vặt đến tận lúc từ giã cõi đời trong thẳm sâu tâm hồn?”. Dường như chẳng có gì là tuyệt đối cả, ngay cả việc ta luôn nghĩ rằng không gì thoát được lưới trời hay tạo nghiệp thì phải trả nghiệp. Dường như Keigo ngầm ám chỉ như vậy. Bằng chứng là trong xã hội hàng tỷ người này không chỉ chật chội về số lượng mà còn chật chội về nhân cách nữa. Thế chăng mới có những kẻ máu lạnh đến tàn bạo như các nhân vật của ông!

Không cần phải tóm lược nội dung của tác phẩm bởi vì vẫn như mọi khi, đây không chỉ thuần là một tác phẩm trinh thám mà còn là một màn trình diễn tâm lý vô cùng phức tạp, lắt léo. Dựa trên tâm lý học, tâm thức và nhận thức của chúng ta luôn là một thứ gì đó lươn lẹo, lật lọng và điều đó còn biểu hiện mạnh mẽ hơn ở những người có tài năng vượt bậc, những kẻ cô đơn tận cùng hay những người phải trải qua những sang chấn tâm lý nặng nề. Và họ hay một số trong chúng ta không ít lần lầm tưởng vào bản thân và đưa ra những quyết định để cuộc đời vô tình bị đẩy đến con đường không có chiều ngược lại.

Người phụ nữ kinh khủng như kẻ mạo danh Shinkai Mifuyu liệu có tồn tại trên đời này không? Có quá nhiều nhân vật trong tác phẩm nhưng đều không khó nhớ bởi vì họ đều trực tiếp hoặc gián tiếp liên quan đến Mifuyu, thậm chí có những nhân vật chỉ thoáng qua hoặc gần cuối truyện mới lộ diện. Tất cả sự có mặt của họ là những bóc tách từng bước một về sự thật giả luôn được ngụy trang một cách khéo léo cho nhân vật chính nhưng họ cũng đã và đang trở thành những con rối của Mifuyu và của chính họ. Dường như ai cũng có khả năng trở thành tội phạm nhưng không phải ai cũng có thể quay đầu. Như Masaya đã mù quáng trượt dài trên con đường tội lỗi với thứ ảo tưởng về một hạnh phúc xa vời, có thể thứ tình yêu đó cũng là sự lầm tưởng hoặc ngộ nhận bởi sự cô đơn mất phương hướng và kể cả sự phụ thuộc tuyệt đối vào thứ gọi là sự cứu tinh.

Có vẻ như Keigo muốn nhắn gửi rằng trong cuộc sống này, người ta không chỉ điều tra các vụ án, người ta còn luôn nghi ngờ và điều tra lẫn nhau. Cảnh sát điều tra tội phạm, người tình điều tra người tình, bạn bè điều tra bạn bè và gia đình điều tra các thành viên trong đó. Và để thỏa mãn những tò mò ấy, chúng ta phải mất quá nhiều năm tháng với những trả giá và mất mát. Có những người không hẳn là tốt nhưng không quá tệ dễ bị đẩy đến đường cùng, có người vì những ràng buộc của quá khứ mà muốn hoặc buộc phải trung thành với cái ác.

Thông minh, trơ tráo, lạnh lùng và tàn độc. Mifuyu đúng là kẻ như vậy. Để che giấu thân phận, mạo danh người khác để trở thành kẻ nắm chuôi tất cả mọi thứ. Là kẻ có thể thản nhiên ăn cắp trí tuệ và sự sáng tạo của người khác, là người bình tĩnh dửng dưng trước nỗi đau và cái chết, luôn lợi dụng tài năng để trục lợi cho riêng bản thân bằng dã tâm bất chấp thủ đoạn, là kẻ có khả năng thao túng đối tượng bằng những toan tính vô cùng cẩn trọng. Nhân vật ấy phải chăng là tổng hợp của nhiều dạng tâm lý, nhiều bộ mặt nhân cách được gửi gắm vào!?

Xã hội Nhật Bản là guồng quay của một nền văn hoá kín kẽ. Việc bộc lộ và thể hiện con người thật là khó có thể. Những chất chứa không nói cùng ai đã vô tình hình thành những nhân cách quái đản nhưng được ngụy trang bởi sự văn minh kiều diễm. Đương nhiên, đó cũng chỉ là điều tương đối.

Tóm lại, mình thích tác phẩm này. Độc giả chúng ta chính là những nhà điều tra và là người phán xét. Mifuyu cuối cùng là một nhân vật hay chỉ là một ảo ảnh của bóng đêm trong tâm hồn của những tội ác lưu lạc đó đây!?",4,1 like,13

Trời ơi! Mình vừa mới đọc xong và cảm giác thật khó chịu, kiểu rất là bồn chồn bất an ><

Mình nhai cuốn này chắc phải 3 tuần rồi. Cuốn nào của Keigo cũng vậy, cứ đến gần cuối là không thể nào rời mắt được. Đầu óc mình quay cuồng choáng váng bởi quá nhiều các tình tiết gây bất ngờ TvT.

Một số cảm nhận của mình về các nhân vật, mình sẽ viết về Mifuyu trước tiên (bởi vì ấn tượng của mình về nv này là quá mạnh) và mình sẽ viết dưới góc nhìn hết sức chủ quan.

Mifuyu - Đây là một nhân vật, một hình tượng người phụ nữ được xây dựng vượt quá sức tưởng tượng của mình. Mình không thể nào hình dung ra được một con người máu lạnh như vậy.
Phải nói là mình thực sự khâm phục cô ta, các kế hoạch, sư tính toán, tầm nhìn của cô ta là ở bậc thượng thừa. Tất cả các kế hoạch đều được tính toán một cách tỉ mỉ, những chi tiết ngay dù là nhỏ nhất đều không bị bỏ qua. Sự thao túng, ma lực của cô ta như là một loại bùa mê vậy.
Càng đọc, mình càng cảm giác cô ta như một sinh vật gì đó, bởi mình không cảm nhận được một chút tình người nào ở nhân vật này. Cũng giống như Kato, mình tự hỏi không biết Mifuyu lấy đâu là cái nguồn động lực kinh khủng đến như vậy, nguồn đọng lực đó chắc hẳn phải kinh khủng đến mức huỷ hoại nhân cách của cô ta, biến cô ta thành một sinh vật máu lạnh, thèm khát sự thành công, địa vị và danh vọng đến mức mất đi lòng vị tha và tình người luôn rồi.
Ban đầu, mình tưởng rằng Mifuyu không quan tâm đến ai khác ngoài Masaya, rằng trong trái tim lạnh như băng đó còn có một tia lửa nhỏ xíu để cô ta quan tâm và là một con ng thực sự. Nhưng khi biết được Masaya - người đã hết mực yêu thương và đồng hành với cô cũng chỉ là một con tốt trong caia ván cờ ghê tởm của cô thì mình thực sự cảm thấy ghê tởm ><

Có một điều mình để ý ở các tác phẩm của Keigo nói riêng và của Nhật Bản nói chung (anime, manga, phim ảnh, sách truyện,...), họ rất thích tạo ra các nhân vật hoàn hảo không một góc chết như thế này, mà càng hoàn hảo thì càng lạnh lùng. Ở trường hợp của Mifuyu thì phần người của cô ta biến mất luôn rồi, bây h, cô chỉ là một con thú đang sinh tồn thôi. Mình thật không tưởng tượng được một con người sống mà không cần bất kì một tình cảm nào. Chắc chẳng mấy khi cô ta thấy lạnh nữa, bởi vì cô ta đâu cần hơi ấm đâu mà

Masaya và Kato - Hai anh chàng đáng thương này thì khỏi nói rồi 😞. Thiệt là tội nghiệp cho Masaya, cái số của anh quá là hãm, tự nhiên lại bị dính vào cái người phụ nữ này. Thử tưởng tượng rằng mình tìm được người mình yêu, dành toàn bộ sự tin tưởng và thậm chí là trao cả trái tim cho người đó, làm mọi điều vì người đó. Để rồi biết rằng mình chẳng là gì đối với người đó cả, thậm chí còn bị người đó phủ nhận sự tồn tại 🙂, bị sai khiến như một con rối vậy 🙃. Làm đủ mọi chuyện kinh khủng, ngoan ngoãn như một con chó theo chủ, để rồi chẳng nhận được cái lol gì, không một lời từ biệt, tất cả những gì Masaya nhận được là một cái liếc mắt lạnh như băng thôi đó 🙂. Còn Kato thì đã có thể nói là đã cống hiến hết quãng đời cũng như sự nghiệp của anh ta cho người phụ nữ này, để rồi nhận lại lấy một cái chết lãng xẹt.

Có lẽ mình quá ngây thơ, nhưng một số hình tượng người phụ nữ mà Keigo xây dựng nên thật sự quá sức tưởng tượng của mình. Sự nguy hiểm, sự tính toán, lòng kiên định và trái tim lạnh băng của họ làm cho mình sốc toàn tập ><.

Có lẽ đến đây thôi 😁, bài viết của mình khá chủ quan và hơi nhiều cảm xúc cá nhân, chắc là do mình mới đọc xong và thây overwhelming quá. Có khi mấy hôm sau ngẫm nghĩ lại mới khác quan hơi được 🤪

Bạn nào đọc hết thì mình cảm ơn nhé 😁",4,1 like,13
review_398820994,Sandra,"Aug 23, 2012","I love Higashino's writing. With that said, this book I found disturbing. The premise is that Heisuke Sugita, a loving husband and father whose world rotates around family, turns on the television to hear of a horrible bus accident, a bus that his beloved family was on. His wife died protecting her daughter. The daughter lies sleeping in a deep coma.

When Monami, his daughter, awakens the spirit and mind of the mother, Naoko, resides in her daughter's body. I can't go into too much detail concerning the plot as it would be a spoiler! Higashino's writing is the most plot driven I've read. Suffice it to say that the tale of this Japanese family becomes stranger and stranger. Heisuke believes his wife lives on in his daughter. Monami cooks for her father/husband. All of his favorite dishes are prepared just as Naoko did. She has long conversation with him as he refers to her by the wife's name. In many ways it's as if he has lost neither his wife or daughter.

Heisuke becomes more and more obsessed with his daughter's personal life, her friends and her plans for the future. At one point Monami speaking through her daughter's mouth bemoans the situation of Japanese women.

""Even if she [a wife] comes to dislike her husband - and don't misunderstand me, I'm just speaking hypothetically - even if she doesn't want to be with him anymore, she can't leave because her future would be uncertain.""

These words trouble Heisuke leading him to watch his daughter more closely than ever. A weird jealousy develops in the husband/father.

Higashino's one of my favorite authors, but this particular novel disturbed me. I thought about the line from Shakespeare's Hamlet when Horatio says after the ghost of Hamlet's father speaks. ""Oh day and night, but this is wondrous strange."" Wondrous strange is an apt description for what occurs. Although I admire and will rave about Higashino's work, I would not recommend this one. It makes for a twisted tale edging too close to bizarre for my taste.

Naoko for some would be a thoughtful commentary on a woman's role in Japan with intelligent insight into what choices a person might make if given the chance to relive life with the knowledge of the limitations of traditional choices imposes.",0,42 likes,14

And just as I did with Suspect X, I finished this in 2 days. All reviews talk about how the spirit of the mother lives in the body of her daughter after the fatal accident. But that is just the tip-of-the-iceberg. This book is really about how the husband adapts to life after the accident, how he struggles with the confusion of whether he's a husband, or a father. ""Did I lose a wife, or did I lose a daughter?"" What I like about the book is how the Father's actions are so believable in an unbelievable situation, if you like and understand Asian culture, that is. And of course, I'm a sucker for heart-wrenching endings. At the end of the book, I simply had to walk out and take a deep breath.

I was hoping for a dark comedy like Murakami Ryû, incisive social commentary like Kirino Natsuo, or skin-crawling disturbance like Mishima Yukio. Maybe even all three. I mean, love and grief are heady emotions, and this premise had the potential for being a real mindfuck of a story, but somehow it just didn't work.

review_226073898,Michele Weiner,"Oct 21, 2011","** spoiler alert ** Naoko won the Japan Mystery Writers Award, but this is not a mystery at all. It is a science fiction tale, or a fable. The hero, factory foreman Heisuke Sugita is a simple man, a traditional and loving Japanese husband to his spirited wife Naoki and hard-working father of one daughter, Monami. In 1985, Heisuke sends his family on a school-sponsored skiing trip to Nagano without him. When the bus they are in plunges off a mountain, Naoki is killed instantly. Monami lingers in a coma for a few days. When she finally wakes, it is clear that something is horribly awry. Although Monami's body has survived, it is Naoki's spirit that animates her. Heisuke and Naoki struggle to deal with all the implications of their situation. Naoki must pretend to be Monami in public, but performs all the tasks of a Japanese wife in private, except one. The husband and wife cannot bring themselves to express physical affection--- after all, Monami is only 12 years old. They maintain a sort of equilibrium for almost five years, during which time Heisuke explores the causes of the crash, discovering the bus driver's secret and meeting both his first and second wives and his son and step-daughter. His wife, growing into adolescence in her daughter's body, learns to do her school work, speak to her friends, and decides to go to medical school. When she begins to blossom and to look more grown, the boys begin to show interest in her, creating a crisis. Heisuke is jealous. He begins to spy on Monami, recording her phone calls and slinking around her room when she's gone. He is jealous and follows her on her first date to chase the boy away. Monami goes home with him, and they become estranged, uncomfortable. They realize they can't go on this way. They attempt to have sex, but neither can do it. It seems as if they have reached an impasse. Naoki is depressed. The inarticulate Heisuke prays something will change. The reader wonders whether violence will follow and who will commit it. But then, one night Naoki falls suddenly asleep and without warning, Monami's personality emerges. She is confused, dazed. She has no memory of the years between the accident and her second year of high school. She can only stay awake for a few hours at a time at first, but is soon able to go to school. Miraculously, she is able to do the hard work she has never learned. Heisuke is overjoyed, but also saddened. He hopes Naoki and Monami can share the body, but slowly, over months, Monami becomes dominant. Naoki hints that she will recede willingly, and writes a letter to explain to Monami what has happened. And another letter telling Monami what to do. As Heisuke begins to be concerned about Naoki's survival, Monami asks him to take her to a special park in Yokohama, where her mother and father had their first date. Heisuke, fearful but resigned, prepares with a new boom box and music specially selected to please Naoki, even though buying the CD embarrasses him --it is not music preferred by middle-aged men and the clerk in the music store gives him a look. They sit on a bench and look at the sea. Monami tells her father that her mother has left instructions for her to do this. She falls asleep and Naoki appears to thank her husband and say goodbye. There are tears all around. Monami returns to her body, and the book ends with Heisuke beginning to understand that Naoki has never been with him. She died for good the day the bus fell off the mountain, and Monami, his so smart daughter, has put on this elaborate act to protect him. It has been Monami all along, imitating her mother until her father was strong enough to live without her. Monami marries the son (not really) of the bus driver's first wife, and they all live happily. A surprisingly effective book. I didn't see it coming at all. I thought Naoki would just fade away.",4,,14
review_156536531,Alibiserver,"Mar 24, 2011","On first impression, Keigo Higashino’s novel may appear like the typical supernatural family novel type that will bring you close to tears. Upon finishing it, you will be mistaken. It’s a mystery novel where nothing is stolen, no one gets assaulted AND murdered, and clues are left on the reader’s thinking. It is also question of morality, of gender play, and romance. The first time I finished the book, I remembered Henrik Ibsen’s The Doll House, and left me with a puzzling ending that could haunt and wrack you to the brains. Every scene in the book is finely weaved and told and each chapter as riveting as the other. I also give my props to Kerim Tasar for an excellent translation. I’ve have had my share of Vertical book collections and by far, this is one of the best translations I’ve read from them.",5,,14
review_1351820271,Ash,"Aug 01, 2015","This is a 4.7 review.

Also, SPOILERS ARE A - COMING.

Honestly, should I be surprised that Keigo Higashino, the man responsible for Malice, a.k.a the Second Greatest Mindf**k of 2014, shocked me into a stupor when I finished Naoko?

No, I really shouldn't have.
But was I? Heck yes, I was! I mean Higashino weaved that story like a puzzle box that somehow became a gremlin. And it made sense!

Naoko is about a man, Heisuke, whose wife and daughter are in a horrendous bus accident. Now, his wife, Naoko, supposedly dies leaving his daughter, Monami, in a coma. The weirdness happens after she wakes up...as Naoko.

Thus, begins the weirdest 5 year journey between Heisuke and Naoko as they try to keep their relationship but keep up pretenses of how their father/daughter relationship is supposed to be. However, one day Monami wakes up as herself and the dynamic shifts. Will it ever be the same again?

I have to give it to Higashino. In a less experienced author's hands, this story had the potential to be very perverted and sappy. Instead, Naoko showed the characters as realistic in THAT type as you can possibly be. Heisuke was shown to be in an emotional stasis as he considered Naoko to be his wife. He was faithful to her. However, his paranoia and resentment of losing her was logical and sad. In some cases, I expect it's similar to the feelings patents feel when they have to let their children grow up and be an adult. It was very hard for him to let go.

Naoko, man, was she a doozy. She was the typical housewife but being in Monami's body changed the game. She got a do-over and she took advantage of it. As soon as she saw she couldn't be Heisuke's wife anymore, she became his daughter. She excelled in school and sports with the goal of going into medical school which she wound up doing. In my opinion, I don't think Naoko hated her previous life while she was living it but when she started living Monami's, she felt that she settled and should have been more.

I could feel for her, especially since Heisuke wanted to keep her static along with him. However, that changed when it turned out Naoko straight up lied and will keep lying as long as she lives. It takes a certain kind of evil manipulation to pretend your daughter comes back in intervals while you slowly disappear until you're finally ""gone."" But Naoko was never really gone and that nearly killed me along with Heisuke! That was cold and I absolutely loved it. I thought it was zigging and it zagged right off a cliff.

Bravo, Keigo Higashino, Bravo!",4,,14

Very clever. The biggest surprise is that the real mystery is revealed in the last few pages. On the way to the end, everything about this story is well crafted, well written and unique. One of the reasons I treasure Japanese stories (which would include manga, anime, books, TV shows and movies) is that there is such creative, out of the box thinking. I am addicted to it because it expands my mind. It makes me think about things that would never had occurred to me. I love thinking and I especially like thinking about new, untried and untested, ideas that allow me to journey to corners of my mind that I haven't visited.

Not even smile inducing kinds. The ending, however, was proper Keigo Higashino styled punch to the guts. Though not sure why this book is listed under mystery genre. I am not sure what genre it should be listed under but mystery doesn't quite cut it. It is sheerly through Keigo's penmanship that you get thrown on this roller coaster ride of emotions as you empathize, hate, pity and get repulsed by the protagonist Heisuke and his 3rd person narrated stream of consciousness. And like the blurb advertises, the ending is soul shattering. The emotion which the protagonist feels leaps from the pages and clenches your heart and takes a life of its own. The ending is very 'Usual Suspects' meets 'Et tu Brutus' moment. And that emotion creeps up on you and blindsides you with the most visceral gut wrenching kick to your gonads that your entire consciousness doubles up in pain. The reason this book doesn't get a full 5/5 is the fact that, Keigo's need to stir in an overdose of Red Herrings in a family drama setting gives the vibe of a never ending day time television series.",4,6 likes,14

review_3545957446,jasmine,"Apr 07, 2021","While Keigo Higashino is known for his thriller/investigative works, Naoko is more of a contemporary fiction that explores the family dynamic and inner desire.

A factory worker (Heisuke) came back from work and learned that the bus that carried his wife (Monami) and daughter (Naoko) fell off a cliff. Both are in severe condition and Monami shortly passed away from this incident. After Naoko woke up from a coma, we found out that the consciousness belongs to Monami.

The scenario sets out a bizarre story where Heisuke learned to live with his daughter/wife, or perhaps no one. The need for emotional and physical intimacy slowly breaks Heisuke as he couldn't comprehend the situation. His resentment towards her is sad and disturbing. On the other hand, Naoko portrays the status of women in Japan, being stuck at the moment and fighting her way out of the entanglements.

The book portrays the spiritual elements that are engraved in its culture, the critique on gender relations and the epidemic of loneliness in Japan. It's gripping, poignant and simply strange.

review_2045155599,Pooja,"Mar 02, 2018","I am a huge fan of Higashino. In fact, I recommend him to everyone who like mystery books stating he is better than any American writer they would have read.
Given that fact, I did not enjoy this book. It lacked the core element of Higashino’s writing - the unexpected. The development and the climax of the story was completely predictable and hence, disappointing. Well, I did enjoy the part where Heisuke asks to punch Fumiya.

From the beginning I could not digest how easily Heisuke accepts the death of his daughter and the fact that his wife’s spirit is now inhabiting his daughter’s body. It was also disturbing how Naoko and Heisuke almost do not mourn their daughters demise and simply go on living their weird lives. It was hard to like Heisuke who was depicted of misogynistic mindset that as long as he gets good food and a woman home, he doesn’t care about anything else much. Oh but he does, sex! The concern over how he would manage without it.. or should he do it with his daughter? I feel sick writing it, but I did not feel sick reading it; and that is the main problem with the book. I did not feel a thing during the incest thoughts and actions. I am not sure whether it was because of loss of emotion in translation or because Higashino wanted it so. Perhaps I have read so much worse in the news nowadays that this didn’t shock me. Whatever the reason, the book did not stir any feelings of disgust, sympathy or understanding.

On top of this, both the main characters were neither likeable nor relatable. Heisuke was too non-conflicted to be likeable and Naoko was made too perfect to be true.
I am giving it 2 stars for Higashino’s attempt at slight mystery of bus driver’s circumstances and because the respect I have for his writing.",2,5 likes,14

The novel is beautifully written and the premise is very intriguing but the actions and emotional changes in the father become more disturbing as Naoko starts drifting away from him.

This book is a commentary on the status of women in Japan, a tribute to the huge spiritual and paranormal element to their culture and a mind bender.

Overall I could not bring myself to read past halfway because it was just a little too frightening. I was afraid that the father/Naoko relationship would get sexual or just continue to be creepy and make me wonder too much about death.

review_2652686178,Jolien,"Jan 07, 2019","review on my blog The Fictional Reader

I saw this book in my local library and thought it looked really interesting. I’m trying to read more books by foreign authors/translated books, and Naoko fit in perfectly with that goal. On the cover, it said that the author won the Japanese Mystery Writers Award with this novel which immediately drew my attention. After finishing the book, I honestly don’t understand why. Not because this book isn’t good – it really is – but because I wouldn’t describe this as a mystery novel at all. I really have no idea how to classify this book.

Naoko follows a family: Heisuke, a factory worker, Naoko, his wife, and Monami, their daughter. Heisuke works nights shifts every few weeks, and at the start of the novel he is eating his dinner with the TV on in the background when he notices the news reporter talk about a bus accident. The bus his wife and daughter were traveling on fell into a ravine, and there were very few survivors. Both Naoko and Monami have been taken to the hospital, and Heisuke rushes there as well. Naoko passes away almost immediately, but Monami wakes up in the hospital. Only she’s convinced she isn’t Monami at all, but Naoko instead. She knows things only his wife should know, but her body is that of their 11-year-old daughter.

That premise sounded incredibly intriguing to me. Would this be a supernatural type book? Or does Monami simply suffer from trauma which results in split personality disorder or PTSD?

What I loved most about this book is that it’s really unassuming, but raises a lot of questions at the same time. It made me think about what I would do in each of the characters’ positions. Heisuke’s wife has passed away, but not really. He doesn’t really mourn her, because her spirit and personality seems to be there anyways. Instead, they have to mourn their daughter, even though her body is still walking around the house every day. It’s an intriguing look at the different ways everyone grieves for lost loved ones.

At the same time, they are faced with a lot of questions. Should Naoko try to do her best and get high grades, make a lot of friends, so that if Monami’s spirit returns her life will be in order? Or will her daughter never return, and should she look at it as a second chance to live the life she never could? Should Heisuke move on and find a different partner, even though his wife is technically still there? There are so many aspects to consider in their new life, and I honestly don’t know how I would handle it.

I loved the way Naoko seemed to try her best to live the life she never could. She got incredibly high grades, got on the career track that was closed to her before, and made new friends. She wanted to be a woman who didn’t have to rely on her husband later, something she regrettably wasn’t before.

I loved how Heisuke tried to support her, while struggling with his feelings at the same time. He wanted her to have a good life, or their daughter to have a good life if she came back, but was also saddened to know his wife wasn’t truly happy in their life together.

This novel is truly a character study. A glimpse at the lives of a family so completely overthrown after an accident. We follow their family for quite a few years, as Monami/Naoko is a grown-up woman by the end of it. The novel is quite short, yet manages to portray a significant amount of years without making it seem fleeting at all.

What I didn’t like about the book is the focus on Heisuke’s sexual life and health, while completely ignoring that of Naoko. Since we’re in Heisuke’s head, we frequently witness him masturbate (I made that sound really weird, sorry) and deal with the conflicting feelings of his wife now being a child, and the teacher he really likes. That teacher thing came out of nowhere, by the way, and really grossed me out. I could have done with less focus on his sex life. On the other hand, I wish it would’ve explored that of Naoko more. She’s an adult woman, yet is now stuck in the body of a pre-pubescent child. Surely, that must cause conflicting feelings since her mind has been ready for and enjoying sex for years, but her body is now incapable of doing so.

Overall, I found this novel absolutely fascinating. Aside from the one downside mentioned before, I was hooked by this family’s story. The synopsis mentions a soul-shattering ending, and it is definitely not kidding. I couldn’t believe the author ended the story there! Is it a trend nowadays to withhold answers from the audience?

If this premise sounds at all interesting to you, I would highly encourage you to pick this book up. It’s a fascinating look in to the life of a family whose reality has been turned upside down, and the ways they find to deal with it. While I wouldn’t categorize this as a mystery novel whatsoever, I do understand why it won an award. I’m so grateful my library had a copy of this, and that I came across it randomly. I’ll probably see whether the author has any other translated works as well.",4,4 likes,14

As Naoko plunges into her newfound life in Monami's body, her distress becomes apparent. She is buried in guilt for having ""stolen"" her daughter's life. Yet, her desire to fulfill her own dreams surfaces. Trapped in a dilemma, I personally found Naoko's choices, though painful, cathartic to watch, as she rediscovers the choices and opportunities previously hidden away from her as a traditional housewife in Japan. Through the bittersweet ending, Higashino has proven himself of critiquing society's view of women, and how individuals are willing to navigate between the restrictions of gender binaries.

What started off as a story of loss with supernatural elements (the soul/body mismatching of the mother and daughter), turned against my expectations of mere cute family scenes, into a deeper story with some disturbing and controversial parts. Is she his wife or his daughter? How different is familial love from those of lovers? The way it was simply written from the point of view of the husband/father Heisuke, is very believable in how someone in that situation would have reacted. You really felt for the characters in situations out of their control. The end didn't end the way I thought it was going to, making it more impactful for me.

A very good read with quirky freshness of japanese styled writing, I think I'll look for other books under this author (like now).",4,2 likes,14

review_4630215118,Mia,"Mar 26, 2022","A friend recommended that I read one of Higashino's books, and since I was unfamiliar with his work I opted for Naoko, (published in Japan as Himitsu) which was recognized in 1999 by the Mystery Writers of Japan, Inc. But the book was hardly a mystery and minimally ""a take on gender relations"" as described on this website. Heisuke's wife and daughter were in a bus that veered off a cliff near a ski resort. His wife dies but returns to him in his daughter's body. What follows is a poignant exploration of relationships and human frailty. It examines how one might live one's life if given another chance. It looks at both our immutability and our resistance to letting go.",4,2 likes,14
review_1874015223,Greg,"Feb 08, 2017","Factory worker Heisuke returns from work to learn that the bus that his wife and daughter were on has crashed and they are both in intensive care. His wife Naoko is fading fast, and daughter Monami is in a coma. As Naoko passes away in front of him, Monami begins to stir.

""Darling, here. I'm here"".

With that simple sentence, Higashino takes what was shaping up as a fairly ordinary drama, and gives it a huge twist. Heisuke realises that Naoko has somehow taken over Monami's body, and that it is Monami who has effectively died, not his wife.

Similar situations have been played for laughs in many Hollywood films, but Higashino tells a serious and wrenching tale here. How does a man keep a marriage alive and stay faithful to a wife whom the world perceives is his daughter? How do the two of them navigate the emotional and ethical minefield that this situation presents, not to mention the social expectations of them? How can Heisuke deal with his loneliness as he watches his wife regress back into her childhood and start her life over again, with him on the periphery?

This novel, while not crime fiction, is every bit as complicated and rewarding as you'd expect from this master of Japanese noir, with plenty of twists and turns to keep the most avid mystery fan intrigued.",4,2 likes,14

The story premise was too Marc Levy for my taste. Not that there's anything wrong with it, such story premise just can't get me excited much. Yet, the characterisation, plot, writing and atmosphere were very well-done. Very. Well-done. Mr Higashino's characters were so normal, so believable, trying to live their little lives. I could feel their pains as the story progressed although I already kind of expected what would happen, and the book made me think a lot about human connections, marriage, and the choices that we make in life.",4,2 likes,14
review_1446851788,Bigsna,"Mar 12, 2018","What an absolutely odd and strange story. A little silly, a little tragic, a little dark, a little haunting and in the end a little ruthless - but overall creative and completely unpredictable.
More than two thirds into the book, I was still wondering where the plot was going and what conclusion the story was moving to, so in that way it really is mysterious and kept me guessing up to the very literal end. Perplexed is what I felt going through most of the book. I guess that is why they gave it the Japan Mystery Writers Award.

I'm a Higashino fan, I've enjoyed all his other books, and loved two especially (Journey Under the Midnight Sun and Malice - both of which are brilliant in their own right). He really is a master story teller.
This one, though, is not a quick read. It moves slowly, but pulls you in wanting to understand where things are going and what is going to happen in the seemingly mundane lives of the Sugita family of three. But really, what a strange story it was, until of course it all became clear, near the very end.

After 3 years of having it on my shelf, I'm glad I have finally read it, and the mystery is finally finally over :-)",3,2 likes,14

This book ""asks"" me questions about interpersonal relationships in marriage, and between a person and his self. The story makes us wonder about ethical issues in the context of Asian culture (Japanese). I can't say who is the selfish one in this story because they all have valid points to justify their actions. In the end, I felt speechless.

review_1887127611,HSB,"Jan 21, 2017","I can't remember the last book that got me choked up. It was almost certainly in the pre-goodreads era, though The Hunchback of Nortre Dame, Great Expectations and the death of a character in Song of Kali get me every single time.

I started this immediately after finishing Vertigo which is an emotionally devastating read in its own right, because the idea of another book around a similar concept of a real or imagined personality transfer appealed to me greatly.

To get a disclaimer out of the way, this is not a 'perfect' book; it lags in parts, there are some places that feel a little obviously padded, but irrespective the conclusion it builds up to is entirely worth it and so the 5.

The initial parts of the book have a somewhat comedic feel, like a more high stakes and weird take on the body transference films that were the rage in the late 80s.

Heisuke has just about reconciled himself to the death of his wife when she's back, apparently possessing the body of his 11 year old daughter, Monami, interacting with her friends not like a peer but like the parent of a friend.

It veers into strange disturbing territory as Heisuke and his wife Naoko negotiate a compulsorily sexless relationship, with all its attendant frustrations and as his daughter gets physically older while still being inhabited by Naoko, jealousy.

And then suddenly Monami starts resurfacing.

Without giving too much away, the end is all that it's been cracked up to be by the other reviewers. It left me with a hollowed out feeling very close to actual bereavement.

Câu chuyện phẫu thuật não này mình đã từng được nghe nhắc tới trong bộ phim Lôi báo của Victor Vũ. Cũng là một cuộc phẫu thuật gây chấn động giới khoa học, nhưng để lại những tác dụng phụ hết sức nặng nề.

Quá trình đấu tranh giữa Junichi và Shunsuke thật sự là khốc liệt. Jun đã phải vất vả biết bao để có thể chiến thắng, để không bị bóng ma kẻ giết người chi phối hoàn toàn bản thân mình, dù phải trả giá bằng mạng sống.

Biến thân - Higashino Keigo (Cẩm Hương dịch)

• Điều gì khiến bạn là chính bạn? Mọi người có nghĩ là bộ não không? Chính bộ não sẽ lưu giữ những ký ức, tính cách, thói quen sinh hoạt… và nhiều thứ khác nữa. Não sẽ quyết định cách ta đáp trả lại những kích thích đến từ bên ngoài, giận dữ, trìu mến, hay thờ ơ. Giống như não đang chứa trong nó “cái tôi” của chúng ta vậy, cái làm ta khác biệt với những người khác, “cái tôi” của tôi là khác với “cái tôi” của người đối diện và khác với phần còn lại của nhân loại, dù rằng mọi người vẫn tin rằng thân xác này chết đi không có nghĩa là “cái tôi” cũng biến mất theo. Tạm chấp nhận rằng não người chứa “cái tôi”, chúng ta bắt đầu nghe bác Keigo một câu chuyện về một phần não của người này đang sống trong não của người khác, hay là “cái tôi” của người hiến tạng đang dần thay thế “cái tôi” của người nhận.

• Jun là một thanh niên nhút nhát, ngại va chạm, không bao giờ lớn tiếng gây gổ với ai, luôn là như vậy từ khi cậu còn nhỏ. Rồi tai họa ập đến, Jun bị một tên cướp bắn xuyên đầu, hỏng một phần não. Kỳ diệu là cậu vẫn được cứu sống nhờ vào phẫu thuật thay thế một phần não đã hỏng bằng phần não khác từ người hiến tương thích. Từ sau cuộc phẫu thuật, tích cách, sở thích, lối sống của cậu dần thay đổi. Ban đầu thì có vẻ như Jun trở nên chủ động hơn, hăng hái trong công việc hơn nhưng dần về sau này con người cậu ta đổi khác theo hướng tiêu cực hơn. Những ý nghĩ hung hăng, bất mãn về mọi người, sự phẫn nộ ngày càng được bộc lộ rõ mặc dù trước giờ cậu ta vẫn sống như vậy, mọi chuyện chỉ khác từ khi cậu ta nhận được một phần não từ người khác. Nhận thức được sự thay đổi của bản thân, Jun nghi ngờ phần não được nhận đã khiến cậu đổi khác, khiến cậu có những suy nghĩ tiêu cực, thậm chí giết người, khiến cậu coi thường người con gái cậu từng rất yêu thương. Nhiều lần choàng tỉnh sau cơn đau đầu dữ dội, Jun ghê tởm bản thân vì đã suýt giết người. Chẳng lẽ “cái tôi” của Jun đang dần bị thay thế bởi một “cái tôi” khác, hung hăng, tàn bạo đầy thù hận thậm chí biến thái, tâm thần.

• Mình có nhiều suy đoán trong quá trình đọc. Mình cảm giác những hành động sai trái và tội ác mà Jun gây ra là do chính sâu thẳm tiềm thức của hắn thực hiện, hay là hắn đã luôn khao khát làm những việc đó và biến cố xảy ra đã đánh thức phần tối tăm trong hắn, chuyện một phần não kia chỉ là hắn đang bao biện cho tội ác của mình. Mình đã rất phẫn nộ khi tội ác của hắn đạt đỉnh điểm, trong đầu chỉ rủa “Ch*t m* mày đi con chó này”, không phải là lần đầu mình tiếp xúc với kiểu giết người như vậy qua tiểu thuyết, có lẽ vì nạn nhân đã được sống trong tâm trí mình, họ chết khiến mình cũng phần nào phẫn nộ. Vậy là vấn đề không nằm ở thủ thuật gây án, phi tang mà là người vừa bị hạ sát đã từng được “sống”. Từng có những nhân vật chưa kịp “sống” đã được dùng để tô vẽ cho tội ác của kẻ sát nhân, điều đó làm mình bị trơ cảm xúc.

• Cái kết xoa dịu mình được phần nào. Mình cảm thấy đó là sự cứu rỗi, chi tiết những đốm tàn nhang tuy nhỏ nhưng đắt giá.

• Mình trích dẫn một quan điểm về vấn đề này từ một cuốn sách khác:
“Trong quá trình xem xét điều gì khiến tôi là tôi, tôi quan tâm ‘phần mềm’ như kinh nghiệm, ký ức, niềm tin, v.v., chứ không phải ‘phần cứng’, một khối vật chất xám cụ thể. Cảm giác của tôi rằng tôi là chính mình sẽ không thay đổi mấy nếu toàn bộ kinh nghiệm, ký ức, v.v., được sao chép sang một bộ não tổng hợp, hay thậm chí nếu não của một người khác được lập trình lại để chứa toàn bộ ký ức, niềm tin, v.v., của tôi. Tôi là tâm trí tôi; tâm trí tôi đi đâu thì tôi ở đó. Theo quan điểm này, căn tính của tôi không liên quan gì đến thể xác vật lý, kể cả bộ não.” (trích mục 10.

Cùng thời gian, tính cách của anh thay đổi và trở thành kẻ giết người.

Một lát não được ghép vào ấy vẫn sống và kiểm soát dần tính cách, tâm hồn của anh. Tính ác trong phần ký ức ấy khống chế anh hay ở 1 góc nhìn khác, nó giải phóng những ức chế tuổi thơ của anh để anh biến đổi thành 1 người bạo lực, hung hăng hơn? Ký ức tuổi thơ của những đứa trẻ bị chính cha mẹ, bạn bè, hàng xóm của mình chê cười bởi chúng yếu đuối và tình cảm quá, thì ai chịu trách nhiệm cho những tổn thương vô hình ấy trong não?

Một vấn đề rất Keigo, và xuyên suốt Biến thân, ta sẽ chứng kiến nỗi thống khổ của nhân vật chính, khi được giữ mạng sống sau một tai ương, nhưng lại đánh mất chính con người bên trong của mình, vì đã biến thành một con người khác.

Sẽ thế nào nếu bên trong ta có một thứ gì đó giống như linh hồn, mỗi ngày một xâm chiếm lấy quyền điều khiển con người ta? Sẽ ra sao nếu ta lần lượt hành xử không đúng như chính ta vẫn thường, lần lượt nhìn những người xung quanh - kể cả người ta yêu và yêu thương ta nhất - bị chính ta làm tổn thương?

Nỗi thống khổ của Naruse Junichi, và người yêu anh Megumi, được Keigo mô tả từ tốn, diễn biến chậm nhưng dữ dội, hệt như ta nhìn mồi lửa đã châm trên dây cháy chậm, cứ dần dần tiến tới, và cuối cùng là mồi nổ được kích hoạt. Junichi có thắng được cuộc đấu tranh giành lại chính con người mình hay không? Có thể ta sẽ đoán được kết cục, nhưng hành trình luôn quan trọng hơn đích đến, và Higashino Keigo sẽ không làm ta thất vọng.

Mình đọc xong mới đọc bìa 4 và thấy IPM viết rất khéo, không cụ thể một chi tiết nào có thể làm độc giả bớt bất ngờ khi đọc sách. Review này mình nói luôn ý chính, nhưng cũng không sao nhỉ, vì vài chục trang đầu là hé lộ rồi.

Đây không phải là truyện trinh thám, mà là một tác phẩm khác để Higashino Keigo trình bày những thế lưỡng nan về thế nào là sự sống, thế nào là cái chết, có chăng chuyện sống mà không phải sống, chết cũng không hẳn là chết, như đã từng làm với Ngôi nhà người cá say ngủ, Trước khi nhắm mắt và Bí mật của Naoko.

Naruse Junichi là một thanh niên hiền lành, thậm chí có thể coi là nhút nhát. Một ngày nọ, một tai nạn hy hữu khiến cho một phần não của anh bị tổn thương và có khả năng anh sẽ làm người thự vật suốt phần đời còn lại. May mắn thay, đại học Towa đang nghiên cứu về thì nghiệm cấy não đã tìm được một bộ não tương thích cao với não của Junichi và họ đã tiền hành cấy ghép.
Niềm vui được cứu sống của Junichi không kéo dài được lâu, anh nhận ra tính cách của mình đang dần biến đổi. Anh trở nên nóng tính, bạo lực hơn trước rất nhiều, tình cảm với bạn bè, đồng nghiệp và người yêu cũng bắt đầu thay đổi. Anh bắt đầu tìm hiểu về cuộc sống của người hiến não cho mình và đưa ra quyết định cho phần đời còn lại.
Cuối cùng anh sẽ chọn như thế nào? Sẽ giống như Trương Ba, chọn là “tôi” trọn vẹn hay chấp nhận làm quen với cuộc sống mới và từ bỏ Junichi trước đây?

*Điểm hay:
- Vẫn là Higashino Keigo với lối hành hạ nhân vật quen thuộc. Ông thường đặt các nhân vật của mình vào tình thế tiến thoái lưỡng nan (mình thấy ở Việt Nam có Nguyễn Ngọc Tư cũng thương có cách làm tương tự).
- Cách viết đơn giản, câu chuyện dễ nắm bắt, các nhân vật có ít chiều sâu nhưng đều có vai trò nhất định trong tác phẩm.

* Điểm chưa hay:
- Các chi tiết về tình dục và kinh dị được miêu tả khá thô và có phần phản cảm, để tạo drama là chính.
- Nhân vật chính không có chuyển biến về tâm lý. Tất cả các nhân vật từ chính đến phụ đều chỉ có một tâm lý đi từ đầu đến cuối truyện.
- Nếu đoạn cuối có một plot twist thì quá hay, nhưng rất tiếc mong chờ của mình đã không thành hiện thực.
- Tác giả để Junichi và người hiến não có tính cách hoàn toàn trái ngược nhau (giống hồn Trương Ba da hàng thịt của Việt Nam) là một nước đi quá an toàn, kết thúc vì thế cũng không bất ngờ. Các nét tính cách đều là trắng hoặc đen, không có vùng xám. Nếu cho hai nhân vật này có nét tương đồng nhưng cũng có khá biệt thì sẽ hay và mang tính đột phá hơn.",3,0 likes,16

Mạch truyện khúc đầu là miêu tả cụ thể diễn biến cảm xúc, nội tâm của anh chàng sau khi được phẫu thuật ghép não. Những tưởng mọi thứ bình thường nhưng cuộc đời không bao giờ bình thường như chúng ta nghĩ. Quyển sách để lại nhiều câu hỏi cho chính người đọc về cái chết về sự sống. Qua đó mình còn biết thêm về khái niệm phức cảm Oedipus. Đọc khúc 18+ thật cảm ơn dịch giả, dịch đoạn này xuất sắc luôn, rất real mà kinh lắm luôn! 🙃 Đọc 1 số chỗ thì mình có cảm giác nó hơi nghiên về dark science. Thế giới khoa học, để có được những nghiên cứu thành công thì đằng sau đó, tất nhiên là có những điều khủng khiếp vô cùng. Đọc mà thấy đau lòng cho nạn nhân. Haiz. Đọc xong thấy mệt hẳn rồi không biết đánh giá quyển sách này hay hay dở nữa. Nhưng anw, hãy tìm đọc để trả lời được những câu hỏi mà tác giả đã đặt ra. Quyển sách này hơi khác biệt chút so với mấy câu chuyện của chú Keigo nhưng đâu đó chúng ta vẫn thấy sự tương đồng với Người cá say ngủ và cả Bí mật Naoko. Vì nó cũng nghiên 1 chút về giả tưởng. Không biết chú có lấy cảm hứng từ việc ghép não rình rang năm nào không? Nhưng đúng mà, con người luôn muốn tìm ra sự bất tử, nên những điều như vậy, mình nghĩ rồi cũng sẽ xảy ra thôi.

Quyển sách này không được đánh giá cao, nói hơi kì, nhưng không biết có phải không phải NN xuất bản nên không nổi hay không :))) Chắc tại khúc đầu diễn biến tâm lí nv nhiều quá thành ra nó hơi… Nhưng mình thấy nó để lại nhiều câu hỏi cho mình phải suy nghĩ. Thì đó là quyển sách ổn!

Từ một công nhân hướng nội, tốt bụng và nhút nhát - Jun nhận thấy những biến đổi trong hành vi, lời nói, nhân cách và suy nghĩ của bản thân từ cuộc phẫu thuật ghép não không có phép của bệnh nhân (dù còn sống hay đã chết). Cuốn sách này khiến tôi phải suy tư:

1) Đạo đức làm y và thí nghiệm trên cơ thể người.
Vấn đề này không quá xa lạ. Vì học thức nhân loại mà đánh mất nhân tính. Những bác sĩ trong hoàn toàn đắm chìm trong ham muốn phát triển kỹ thuật cấy ghép não mà không từ thủ đoạn đối với chính bệnh nhân, cũng là nạn nhân của họ.

2) Sự dày vò vì biến đổi tâm lý của nv9 chính là địa ngục.
Nhận thức được bản thân đang đánh mất chính mình, mất đi tình yêu dành cho mọi thứ, mất đi quan hệ vốn ít ỏi và đến cả cội nguồn và ký ức; thay vào đó là sự đố kỵ, hận thù thế gian, ham muốn giết chóc, v.v. Khi nhận thức anh dần bị xâm chiếm bởi một kẻ giết người mắc phức cảm oepidus.

3) *TRIGGER WARNING*
Quan hệ tình dục với xác chết (necrophilia) và giết người chặt xác.

4) Jun là một nhân vật có bản chất vô cùng kiên cường và nhân hậu.
Khi bạn gái (Meg) gặp nguy hiểm do cơ thể bị nắm giữ bởi kẻ giết người, linh hồn còn sót bởi Jun luôn bảo vệ cô. Cảm xúc của Jun thật có tác động mạnh mẽ với cơ thể của anh cho đến phút cuối. Và lúc anh tự sát (dù khúc sau được tiết lộ là 'không thành'), mình thực sự cảm thấy thương cảm cho số phận và sự kiên cường quyết tìm lại bản thân của nhân vật này.

5) Thương Meg lắm luôn TvT
Mình có lẽ thích nhân vật này nhất truyện rồi;; cô yêu bạn trai của mình (Jun), trực giác phát hiện có điều gì sai ở ngày Jun xuất viện ngay. Tuy ban đầu bỏ trốn vì không dám đối mặt với biến đổi trong người mình yêu nhưng cô vẫn quyết tâm quay về và bảo vệ anh dù tính mạng gặp hiểm nguy do cơ thể bị chi phối của Jun. Mặc dù về sau càng mù quáng bất chấp bảo vệ Jun khỏi cảnh sát vì tội giết người nhưng có lẽ đó là vì biết Jun thật vẫn còn nằm trong cơ thể đó.

Nhưng như một ly trà sữa đậm vị sau thời gian dài mới được thưởng thức lại. Ngụm đầu tiên hưng phấn ngon lành bao nhiêu thì càng uống càng thấy quá ngọt và ngấy bấy nhiêu. Từ đây trở đi, mọi việc cứ theo đà tăng dần đều như dự đoán. Việc đọc trở thành nhàm chán, ráng đọc cho nhanh, cho hết vì cuốn này nóng lòng nên không đợi mua online giảm 35% mà ngu người ra nhà sách mua nguyên giá.
Phần giữa sách quá giông dài khi viết về một nhân vật đang bị ảnh hưởng bởi tính cách bạo lực nửa vời làm người đọc rất ức chế. Đọc một chút là phải nghỉ vì nó gây cảm xúc đen tối, nhưng thay vì ngưng ở đó để đọng cảm xúc cho người đọc thì nó lại kéo dài liên miên cuối cùng lại gây nhàm chán. Kết thúc cuối cùng nhân vật chả đưa bản thân mình đi được đến đâu, giết người, rồi cố tìm lại bản thân bằng việc vẽ rồi tự sát để lại tác phẩm hội hoạ gây tiếng vang. Không có gì mới mẻ và bất ngờ. Sẽ còn tiếp tục đọc sách của Cụ nhưng cho đến thời điểm hiện tại đây là cuốn gây thất vọng nhiều nhất.
P/s: Bìa phụ cuốn sách nói lên tất cả nội dung cuốn sách (cho 385 trang sách chỉ có nhiêu đó). Art direction siêu thẳng ruột ngựa và tính thẩm mỹ tệ kinh khủng, font chữ tên tác phẩm cũng chả liên quan. Phải chi bạn thiết kế bìa đưa cái bìa chính bên trong ra ngoài, ""đậm"" và chất hơn, tuy nhiên chắc sẽ khó bán sách hơn vì cái thị hiếu thích cái gì cũng phải rõ ràng, sông sốc và đập thẳng vào mặt của người Việt.",1,0 likes,16

Hai cuốn gần đây nhất mình đọc của bác Keigo hơi chán, tưởng mình bị chán truyện bác nhưng đến quyển này thì nhận ra là mình ko thích những tác phẩm mà bác sáng tác lâu rồi. Mấy cuốn kiểu nghiêng về trinh thám cổ điển ý. Mình thích những cuốn kiểu tâm lý như thế này hơn.
Cuốn này rất hay. Có lẽ nếu từng suy nghĩ về linh hồn, cái gì đang điều khiển tôi, tôi là ai, cái gì đang suy nghĩ (cái gì đang gõ ra những dòng này) thì chắc sẽ thích cuốn này :D Không plot twist, không li kì. Đơn thuần là những thay đổi về suy nghĩ, tâm trạng của một con người mà lại không đơn thuần chút nào.

Không nhắc đến tình huống trong truyện để khỏi spoil =))) Nhưng có lúc nào đó nhìn lại chính mình của 10-5- thậm chí chỉ năm ngoái thôi, đã thấy mình đã suy nghĩ khác, cảm nhận khác về cùng 1 chủ đề, đối tượng nào đó. Chẳng hạn ngày xưa mình từng rất thích truyện ngôn tình sướt mướt, giờ đọc thấy nhảm v~ =)) Mình từng thấy thích một người da diết cả 10 năm liền nhưng rồi cũng không còn cảm giác gì nữa =)) Hay mình từng dễ nổi nóng, quát tháo mà giờ quá lười để nói to =)) Vậy tất cả những mình của năm tháng cũ ấy có thật là ""mình"" không? Hay ""mình"" đây mới là mình.

Ngày xưa mỗi lần chia tay ai thì người ta đều bảo ""m thay đổi rồi"". Mình luôn nói không, không thay đổi đâu vẫn là t thôi chỉ là mấy cái dây thần kinh trong đầu t ko muốn nghĩ về m nữa. Hay những lúc thấy buồn vcl mà lí do thì ngớ ngẩn khùng điên. Mình tự nhủ cảm xúc chỉ là những chất hóa học đổ vào dây thần kinh trong não. Chính nó gây nên cảm xúc này chứ chẳng phải tại cái gì cả. Một ý tưởng có vẻ ngớ ngẩn mà lại đúng ghê :D Vậy thì ""mình"" là gì đây? Câu này khó trả lời quá nhưng mình nghĩ mình có thể làm được nhiều thứ. Bộ não là thứ có thể ""train"" được. Chỉ cần nghĩ khác đi. Thử làm vài thứ khác bình thường cũng không sao đâu =)) Kiểu thế đó =))",5,0 likes,16

Gấp lại cuốn sách này thực sự để lại cho t nhiều cảm xúc và suy nghĩ. Bác Keigo lại một lần nữa gây cho t nhiều trăn trở.

Biến thân không phải truyện trinh thám mà là truyện tâm lý. Và có lẽ ai đọc truyện của bác rồi cũng biết bác rất mạnh về điểm này.

Một chàng trai bị thương ở não và được thực hiện ca cấy ghép não đầu tiên trên thế giới đã ra sao? Cuộc sống của anh bị đảo luộn như thế nào? Keigo thực sự đã rất thành công khi viết về điều đó. Truyện kể theo ngôi thứ nhất nên khi đọc từ đầu truyện đến cuối truyện ta hoàn toàn có thể thấy được sự chuyển mình của nhân vật. Đôi khi ta thấy nó đau đớn quằn quại đôi khi lại im lặng lạ lùng. Khi gấp lại cuốn sách và nhớ lại thì thực sự đầu truyện - cuối truyện liệu có phải là một người ? Não thực sự có ảnh hưởng đến con người ta như thế nào? Khi ta chết đi nhưng thật sự có phải chết đi?

Đọc từ đầu đến 3/5 truyện mình đều thấy nó cũng khá nhẹ nhàng nhưng đến nửa cuối thật sự phải đọc cho bằng hết, không muốn bỏ dở làm việc khác vì nó thực sự gay cấn hơn hẳn. Yếu tố Sexual cũng chủ yếu xuất hiện ở nửa sau và nó cũng khiến mình thấy khá “tởm”.

Lúc đầu đọc được 4/5 định sẽ rate 4 sao nhưng khi đọc xong thực sự nên để 5 sao.

Có thể là nhiều bạn thích những truyện kinh dị và tâm lí sâu thì sẽ thấy cuốn này nhẹ nhàng thôi nhưng mình đánh giá cao ở giá trị quan mà Keigo đưa vào. Con người khi sống thực vật liệu có phải họ đang sống trong một thế giới giả tưởng? Khi bạn biết mình đang đánh mất bản thân mình bạn sẽ làm gì? Phó mặc số phận hay chống lại nó? Bạn nghĩ khi chết đi con người ta sẽ đến đâu?

Thực sự đây là một tác phẩm đáng đọc.",5,0 likes,16

Kết thúc với nhiều cảm xúc rối ren. Nói thật khi đọc xong thì mình chả biết review như nào, nó cứ tạo cho mình cảm giác khó tả gì đó và nhiều điều khiến mình phải suy ngẫm hồi lâu nên khó mà viết ra được nhưng rồi thì mình cũng phải nói ra thôi nếu để trong lòng thì mình chắc mình sẽ nghĩ về nó mãi
""Anh đi đâu?""
""Anh đi lấy lại"". Tôi nói. ""Lấy lại con người của anh""
Thật ra thì đây chỉ mới là quyển thứ 3 của Keigo mà đọc. Quyển này khác so với 2 quyển còn lại mình đọc nó ồ ạt và dạt dào cảm xúc hơn nhiều. Như phần blurb ở phía sau đã giới thiệu thì nhân vật chính sẽ đi tìm lại con người trước đây của mình, mình cứ nghĩ rằng chắc cũng bình thường chả có gì gay gắt đâu và không thể hiểu tại sao vừa đọc vài chương đầu mình lại có cảm giác ghét nó lắm ấy, nhưng vài chương sau thì nó khiến cho mình suy nghĩ khác và bị ""quẹo cổ"" luôn, mình cứ nghĩ một vài nhân vật không liên quan nhưng lại thành ra rất là liên quan :》, tưởng không thích ai ngờ thích không tưởng luôn và mình chỉ hoàn thành nó trong hơn nữa ngày, so với tốc độ đọc của mình trước đây là quá nhanh. Mạch truyện dẫn dắt chi tiết, không bị thừa thải từ kể đến tả, nó kết hợp nhiều yếu tố khác nhau à thôi chả biết nói gì nữa , à điểm trừ cho quyển này là yếu tố kinh dị và có hiếp dâm nữa đọc tới mấy đoạn này thì mình kiểu khựng lại ấy làm mình mất cả vui vì đang cuốn :》》

review_4670861136,Lê Quang Hoàng,"May 22, 2022","Rất nhiều kiểu người chỉ trong một quyển sách. Tính cách của các nhân vật quá nhiều và đa dạng, Jun hiền lành, tử tế; Shunsuke độc ác, man rợ; Megumi hết lòng yêu Jun dù cho biết nguy hiểm; Naoko vì công việc mà hi sinh thân mình; hay các nhân vật phụ như Saga tận tâm giúp đỡ ân nhân rất đáng khâm phục; Usui ăn chơi phá tiền bố mẹ hay các nhân vật trong nhà máy uể oải, lười biếng,... Đó như một xã hội thu nhỏ. Có một cái mình thắc mắc đó là ca phẫu thuật mang tầm thế giới mà chỉ một đại học Towa đảm nhiệm, các tiến sĩ nhìn không ra bệnh thế mà bác sĩ ở một viện tâm thần từ cuộc nói chuyện mà đoán được bệnh luôn, nếu như có bên ngoài hợp tác nữa thì sẽ thuận lợi biết bao, có lẽ từ 'danh vọng' ảnh hưởng quá ghê gớm, có thể thông cảm cho các tiến sĩ vì dù sao đây cũng là bước tiến của khoa học, còn cái thế lực đằng sau mới là vấn đề. Cái mà mình không thích không phải là phần 18+ mà là tính bạo lực trong sách, toàn là suy nghĩ giết người nào là phần cưa con chó, cưa người như phim kinh dị. Vì tác giả là người Nhật nên mình nghĩ những phần 18+ là bình thường, cũng không quá lắm. Từ phần đầu suy nghĩ giết người từ Shunshuke là thấy khá man rợ rồi đến doạn sau càng ngày càng bạo lực, tội nhất là Naoko. Cái kết thì cũng ổn nhưng mình tưởng Jun sẽ bị giết cơ, thế cuối cùng vẫn sống thực vật. Quyển sách có cốt truyện mới mẻ, cũng khá hay và đáng đọc nhưng sẽ chỉ phù hợp với một số người, cân nhắc kĩ trước khi đọc.",4,0 likes,16
review_3474160511,Diệp Hoàng Quân,"Aug 01, 2020","Biến Thân sỡ hữu một cốt truyện khá đơn giản, gần như chỉ cần đọc lời bạt thôi cũng có thể đoán ra được. Một người vừa trải qua một cuộc phẫu thuật thập tử nhất sinh, và phải sống tiếp cuộc đời còn lại bằng những sự thay đổi không thể lường trước. Nhưng cái hay của quyển này không nằm ở đó. Mà nó nằm ở việc lột tả nội tâm của hai tính cách, trong cùng một con người. Keigo đã miêu tả một cách hoàn hảo sự dằn vặt nội tâm khủng khiếp của nhân vật chính. Ngay tại trong thân xác ấy, một cuộc chiến khốc liệt để giành lấy quyền làm chủ của cái thiện và cái ác, của thiên thần và ác quỷ!

Thực ra theo mình, dùng từ cái ác có vẻ cũng không đúng lắm. Trong cả hai nhân cách, đâu là thiện, đâu là ác, ranh giới giữa chúng thật sự rất mong manh. Nếu cái thiện của Jun tượng trưng cho tính cách hiền lành, hòa nhã, thì nó lại đi đôi với nhu nhược, an phận. Với mình phần tính cách còn lại cũng chưa hẳn là ác. Nhanh nhẹn, khao khát khẳng định bản thân, và không dung thứ cho sự giả dối, sai trái. Keigo đã mượn chính phần tính cách ""ác"" đó, để lột tả một sự thật tồn tại trong chính môi trường công sở hiện đại ngoài đời thực. Đó là sự trì trệ, sự an phận, trôi từ năm này sang năm khác, như những mẩu lục bình. Và chỉ cần có kẻ đứng lên vạch trần sự ổn định giả dối ấy, lập tức sẽ bị cô lập, đào thải! Mình thật sự thích phần tính cách ác của Jun ở đoạn này.

Nhịp độ của Biến Thân có thể khá chậm ở đoạn đầu, nhằm mục đích giới thiệu các nhân vật, giới thiệu cuộc phẫu thuật thế kỷ, và hé mở dần những sự biến đổi trong tâm lý của nhân vật chính. Nhưng càng về sau, mạch truyện càng được đẩy đi nhanh hơn, các tình tiết xảy ra liên tục và cứ thế cuốn người đọc đến với cái kết mà không thể ngừng. Đối với những bạn đọc không quen thể loại tâm lý, có thể khá khó nuốt phần đầu truyện. Tuy nhiên nếu đã qua được giai đoạn đầu, mình đảm bảo không thể dừng lại!

Mình cũng khá thích cách mà Keigo Sensei giải quyết câu chuyện. Một cái kết - có thể gọi là happy ending - cái thiện luôn chiến thắng, Junichi nhút nhát đã lần đầu tiên vùng lên và chiến thắng cuộc chiến vĩ đại của cuộc đời mình! Với mình, kết như vậy là thỏa mãn!

À, truyện có đề cập đến tình yêu nữa. Rất nhiều loại tình yêu. Vô bờ bến như tình yêu của Megumi dành cho Junichi, hay điên cuồng và rồ dại như tình yêu của tên sát thủ dành cho người mẹ của mình. Hơn hết, là tình yêu âm thầm nhưng to lớn của Junichi dành cho Megumi. Chính tình yêu đó, đã giúp anh chiến thắng được cái ác vào thời điểm gần như tâm hồn anh đã bị chiếm lĩnh hoàn toàn.",4,0 likes,16
review_4001957011,Phóng Indie,"May 14, 2021","Quan điểm cá nhân của mình thì thấy cuốn này hay
Đặc trung không phải là trinh thám nữa, mà gần như chuyển hẳn sang tâm lý xã hội.
Có một điểm mình thấy thế này: Mình cảm nhận thấy tên cướp văn phòng bất động sản ở đầu truyện về cơ bản không xấu xa. Tiền trình cảm xúc của nhânh vật này từ đầu nghĩ là xấu, nhưng sau đó thấy tất cả những việc anh ta làm đều là do bị "" tức nước vỡ bờ"" căm phẫn người cha đã bỏ mẹ con anh ta ra đi.

Tiếp đến trong truyện lại có những đoạn tác giả nói về bố mẹ của nhân vật chính. Một người mẹ nhu nhược, bao bọc con mình một cách thái quá, người bố thì có phần hà khắc, cổ hủ( đặc biệt là đoạn người bố bắt nhân vật chính phải giết con chuột trong lồng). Vậy nên mình nghĩ, nhân vật chính đã bị kìm nén cảm xúc từ lúc nhỏ và chỉ chờ ngày bùng phát lên thôi. Cái ca phẫu thuật ghép não chỉ như là một biến cố lớn xảy ra trong đời, làm nhân vật chính thay đổi tính cách, cách nhìn nhận của mình về cuộc sống. và phần não của hung thủ được ghép vào cho nhân vật chính như là bản ngã trong tính cách đã thay đổi đó.

vậy 1 phần nào đó, theo mình thấy thì truyện cũng đang phê phán về cách giáo dục của cha mẹ dành cho con cái mình, kiểu "" cha me độc hại""
còn ý nghĩa chính vẫn là sự đấu tranh giữa thiện và ác và tình cảm tình yêu thương lớn lao của cô người yêu dành cho nhân vật chính.",4,0 likes,16

Phải nói rằng truyện của Keigo, dù cho có xuất sắc hay hơi đuối, vẫn mang đc những thông điệp ý nghĩa và có một cái kết chỉ-mình-Keigo-nghĩ-ra. 🧐

Truyện có lối kể khá từ từ và an toàn, chỉ đến 40 trang cuối thì mới thực sự đẩy nhanh và bất ngờ. Mặc dù không có plot twist hoành tráng như quyển ""Phía sau nghi can x"" nhưng ""Biến thân"" thành công trong việc tập trung khắc hoạ sự thay đổi của nhân vật chính.

Một con người vốn hiền lành, sau một cuộc phẫu thuật não được cấy ghép não của người khác, từ từ trở nên hung bạo và có ý định giết người. Đấy chính là tình huống của cuốn sách. Nhưng mượn điều đấy để tác giả Keigo làm nổi bật lên những vấn đề khác.

Nếu như đã đọc ""Bí mật của Naoko, Ngôi nhà người cá say ngủ, Trước khi nhắm mắt"" thì sẽ thấy ""Biến thân"" cũng có điểm chung: rằng nhân vật chính sẽ có thân xác này nhưng linh hồn khác. Ở ""Biến thân"", đó là sự thay đổi tính cách từ từ.

Lồng ghép các kiến thức về cấy ghép não, phức cảm Oedipus cho thấy sự rộng lớn của Keigo về lượng kiến thức, một điều mà mình luôn ngưỡng mộ chú! 😮 Thêm vào đó, những góc tối trong ngành y, cụ thể hơn là các cuộc phẫu thuật được đề cập.

Truyện cũng có ít ít cảnh 🔞, tuy hơi thô bạo nhưng lại diễn tả được suy nghĩ bất thường của nhân vật. Phải nói là 40 trang cuốn là điểm sáng của ""Biến thân"".",4,0 likes,16

Đọc xong Trứng chim cúc cu này thuộc về ai hơi chán, qua tới quyển này thì cuốn hơn hẳn. Truyện kể về nhân vật Jun trải qua ca đại phẫu thuật ghép não sau một vụ tai nạn nghiêm trọng. Những tưởng phẫu thuật thành công, anh sẽ có thể quay về với cuộc sống bình yên và êm đềm bên cô bạn gái Megumi. Nhưng đời không như là mơ. Nhân vật chính dần dần nhận ra những bí ẩn, khuất tất của ca phẫu thuật ghép não cũng như những thay đổi kì lạ trong tính cách con người mình.
Truyện này thuần tâm lý xã hội pha chút xíu kinh dị kì ảo, vibe rất giống với Trước khi nhắm mắt, nhưng miêu tả tâm lý nhân vật xuất sắc hơn nhiều. Đọc rất thấm và rất đã luôn. Nói đúng ra thì khi đọc Biến thân, cảm xúc của mình thay đổi liên tục: ban đầu là tò mò, đọc đến giữa giữa thì bắt đầu thấy bực mình, đi dần đến đoạn kết thì lại thấy thương cho cái tình cảnh éo le của Jun.
Dù nhìn chung thì quyển này khá ổn áp, có vài điểm mình vẫn không thích, mà tiêu biểu nhất là mấy chi tiết 18+ :) Rồi tới cái cảnh quan hệ với xác chết mình kiểu :) :) :) Kinh dị.

Nói về Biến Thân - sau khi gấp cuốn sách lại mình không thể hiểu rõ được trạng thái của mình là như thế nào. Thật ra, quyển này không bẻ lái gắt gỏng như phong cách của bác, và mình cũng phần nào đoán được diễn biến của câu truyện sẽ như thế nào. Nhưng dù đoán được phần kết, tâm trạng của mình cũng khá rối bời. Bởi lẽ mình hiểu rõ nỗi sợ khi đánh mất đi bản thân, nỗi sợ khi chúng ta biết chúng ta không còn là chính mình nhưng chẳng thể làm sao thay đổi được điều đó. Nên mình nghĩ thông điệp mà Keigo Sensei muốn truyền đạt cũng chỉ đơn giản, hãy tôn trọng và yêu bản thân dẫu chúng ta có thế nào đi chăng nữa, bởi vì mọi dấu chân chúng ta đi qua sẽ minh chứng cho sự sống của chúng ta đó hay sao. Gấp lại quyển sách, mình nghĩ fan trinh thám sẽ khá chán chường khi mở ra những trang đầu tiên, nhưng tin tôi đi, nếu các bạn cố gắng hoàn thành quyển sách bạn sẽ nhận ra một thông điệp đơn giản nhưng lại bị chúng bỏ quên trong vô thức.",5,0 likes,16

📚 Jun một thanh nhiên tính tình hiền lành có phần nhút nhát, an phận sống qua ngày. Trong một lần vì cứu một bé gái, Jun bị bắn vào đầu, đã vô tình trở thành người thí nghiệm cho ca phẫu thuật đầu tiên trên thế giới – ca phẫu thuật ghép não.
Sau khi phẫu thuật, cứ ngỡ Jun sẽ có lại cuộc sống như trước kia, nhưng dần dần, Jun cảm thấy bản thân mình đã thay đổi, trở thành một con người hoàn toàn khác với bản thân mình ngày trước. Anh dễ kích động và nóng nảy, thậm chí sở thích hội họa và tình yêu với cô bạn gái Megumi cũng không còn như xưa. Nhận thấy mình đã thay đổi, Jun bắt đầu tìm hiểu sự thật về chân tướng của cá phẫu thuật kia, rốt cuộc, tại sao anh không còn là anh nữa?

📚 Biến thân không phải là một tiểu thuyết trinh thám, mà là cuộc đấu tranh tâm lý giữa các nhân vật, từng biến đổi của Jun, cũng như quá trình đấu tranh để không đánh mất bản thân mình. Không có nhiều pha giật twist như các quyển khác, Biến thân đã mang đến cho mình một trải nghiệm hoàn toàn khác, và mình khá thích quyển sách này vì giá trị quan của nó.

1 cái kết tạm coi là HE sau tất cả những rắc rối, những mưu mô toan tính. chàng trai vẫn giữ lại được 1 chút nhân tính của mình để cứu vớt mọi chuyện, và một phần cũng nhờ có cô người yêu kịp thời quay trở lại.

Ngày kia, tai họa đột nhiên giáng xuống, người ta đưa Jun vào bệnh viện, tiến hành một ca phẫu thuật lần đầu tiên trên thế giới.

Ra viện, Jun trở về với cuộc sống, với người yêu của mình, nhưng anh đã không còn hiền lành, trung hậu nữa. Jun trở nên hung hãn, bản năng và thú tính.

Jun bắt đầu chuỗi ngày dằn vặt, đấu tranh với tính cách mới của bản thân. Cuộc chiến giữa cái thiện - phần bản tính hiền lành của Jun lúc trước và cái ác - phần bản tính mới xuất hiện sau cuộc đại phẫu, diễn ra trong anh.

Và trên hành trình đó, anh bắt đầu khám phá ra sự thật, rằng các bác sĩ đã làm gì với bộ não của anh!

Nhịp độ của Biến thân có thể khá chậm ở đoạn đầu, nhằm mục đích giới thiệu các nhân vật, giới thiệu cuộc phẫu thuật, hé mở dần những biến đổi trong tâm lý của nhân vật chính.

Nhưng càng về sau, mạch truyện càng được đẩy đi nhanh hơn, các tình tiết xảy ra liên tục và cứ thế cuốn người đọc đến với cái kết.

Cũng như hầu hết tác phẩm trước đây của Keigo, Biến thân sở hữu cốt truyện khá đặc sắc. Các tình tiết được liên kết với nhau chặt chẽ, mỗi chi tiết đều đóng một vai trò quan trọng trong việc thêu dệt nên bức tranh toàn cảnh.

Điểm hay nhất ở cuốn sách này có lẽ đến từ việc lột tả nội tâm của hai tính cách trong cùng một con người. Keigo đã miêu tả một cách hoàn hảo sự dằn vặt nội tâm khủng khiếp của nhân vật chính.

Ngay trong thân xác ấy, một cuộc chiến khốc liệt của cái thiện và cái ác, của thiên thần và ác quỷ để giành lấy quyền làm chủ. Bằng cách sử dụng sự đối lập giữa hai tính cách, Keigo đã nêu quan điểm của mình về một vài vấn nạn trong cuộc sống của con người.

Trong cả hai nhân cách tồn tại trong con người của nhân vật, đâu là thiện, đâu là ác, ranh giới giữa chúng thật sự rất mong manh.

Keigo đã đặt ra câu hỏi khiến độc giả phải suy ngẫm: “Liệu phần tính cách ác của Jun, có thật sự hủy hoại anh ấy? Hay chính phần thiện trước đây, đã ăn mòn bản thân anh bằng sự mờ nhạt, an phận?"".

2. Sức mạnh của tình yêu thương
Nếu phần thiện trước đây của Jun tượng trưng cho tính cách hiền lành, hòa nhã, thì nó lại đi đôi với nhu nhược, an phận. Phần ""ác"" lại đi đôi với sự nhanh nhẹn, khao khát khẳng định bản thân, và không dung thứ cho sự giả dối, sai trái.

Keigo đã mượn chính phần tính cách ""ác"" đó, để lột tả một sự thật tồn tại trong cuộc sống chúng ta, những người đang bị rơi vào cái bẫy của sự “ổn định”.

Đó là sự trì trệ, sự an phận, trôi từ năm này sang năm khác, như những mẩu lục bình. Đó liệu có phải là sự ổn định mà chúng ta đang cần? Hay chính điều đó đang giết chết chúng ta từng ngày, từng giờ? Sau cùng, tình yêu thương cũng là vũ khí giúp ta chiến thắng tất cả!

Bên cạnh việc nói lên những mặt tối của con người và xã hội, trong Biến thân, Keigo vẫn có chỗ để tôn vinh tình yêu thương. Rất nhiều tình yêu đã được nhắc đến, từ tình yêu đôi lứa, đến tình cảm gia đình.

Điển hình và dễ thấy nhất, là tình yêu vô bờ bến của Megumi dành cho Junichi. Cô yêu anh vô điều kiện, kể cả anh có trở thành một con người khác, có xua đuổi cô hay thậm chí giết cô, cô vẫn chấp nhận.

Bạn đọc có thể sẽ cảm thấy rất thương Megumi, cô phải đối mặt với một Junichi hoàn toàn khác sau cuộc phẫu thuật, đối mặt sự cô đơn trong chính tình yêu của mình. Nhưng cô vẫn không bỏ cuộc. Và mọi thứ đã được đền đáp xứng đáng.

Tiếp theo đó, tình yêu điên cuồng và rồ dại như tình yêu của tên sát thủ dành cho người mẹ của mình. Keigo đã có đoạn miêu tả điều này: “Tình yêu với mẹ của anh Shunsuke mãnh liệt tới mức không diễn tả được thành lời, yêu đến kinh người ấy. Sau khi mẹ mất, anh ấy nhốt mình trong phòng, cả ngày khóc rống gào thét, đến mức tôi còn sợ anh ấy quẫn trí mà chết mất”.

Nguyên nhân sự hóa điên của nhân vật này cũng xuất phát từ chính cái chết của mẹ anh ta. Điều đó đủ để cảm nhận anh thương mẹ đến nhường nào.

Cuối cùng, tình yêu âm thầm nhưng to lớn của Junichi dành cho Megumi. Cũng chính tình yêu đó đã tiếp thêm sức mạnh cho anh chiến thắng được phần ác trong con người, vào thời điểm gần như tâm hồn của anh đã hoàn toàn nhường chỗ cho nó!

Suốt thời gian bị cái ác chiếm ngự, Jun đã gần như quên mọi thứ thuộc về con người trước đây. Nhưng có một điều Jun không quên, là “không thể quên rằng đã yêu Megumi”.",5,11 likes,16

Lấy cảm hứng từ cuốn “Bí mật của Naoko”, Đơn Phương khai thác về vấn đề giới tính: một người mang cơ thể là nữ nhưng tâm hồn là nam! Phải nói thêm là Keigo còn lồng ghép rất nhiều chủ đề như tình bạn, tình cảm đơn phương(đúng với tiêu đề), bóng bầu dục Mỹ, các mối quan hệ trong xã hội, cái thiện cái ác,.... Tất cả đều ông lồng ghép vô cùng khéo léo trong 1 tác phầm dày ngang ngửa “Bạch dạ hành”!

Không có quá nhiều plot twist như “Phía sau nghi can X” nhưng lại có một cái kết để lại nhiều cảm xúc, tâm trạng như bị mixed lại khiến mình vừa vui vừa buồn, cảm xúc lâng lâng! 😕🙁 nhưng mình lại thích cái cảm giác buồn này, nó khá là ý nghĩa và có thông điệp truyền tải mạnh mẽ!

""รักข้างเดียว"" เป็นนิยายดราม่า เป็นนิยายรักที่ตัดความโรแมนติกออกอย่างสิ้นเชิง
ผูกเรื่องราวไว้บนฐานความสัมพันธ์ของเพื่อนร่วมชมรมสมัยมหาลัย ที่ต้องร่วมกันปกปิดซ่อนเร้นตัวฆาตกร ไปพร้อมๆ กับทำความเข้าใจตัวตนของเพื่อนในฐานะเพศที่ 3

ในเล่มมีตัวละคร LGBT อยู่เยอะมาก อ่านๆ ไป ก็จะมีประเด็นทางเพศน่าขบคิดโผล่ขึ้นมาเต็มไปหมด
อ่านไปก็รู้สึกอึดอัดและเศร้า ที่ตัวละครในเล่มถูกพูดถึงเฉพาะในแง่ ""เพศ""
ต้องเลือกว่าจะเป็นเพศใดเพศหนึ่ง ต้องเลือกที่จะชอบเพศใดเพศหนึ่ง มากกว่าจะมองพวกเขาในฐานะมนุษย์
พอคนๆ ถึงกลายเป็นเพศที่ 3 ดูเหมือนคนก็ไม่สนอีกแล้วว่า พวกเขามีนิสัยใจคอ มีทักษะความสามารถอย่างไร สนใจแค่ว่าพวกเขาคือเพศที่ 3 เท่านั้น

เราจะเห็นความยากลำบากของเพศที่ 3 ทั้งในแง่จิตใจ ร่างกาย สุขภาพจิต สังคม
มองเห็นชัดมากเลยว่า โอกาสทั้งการทำงาน การแข่งขันกีฬา การได้รับการยอมรับไนสังคมของคน LGBT ไม่เท่าเทียมกับคนที่มีเพศชายหญิงแบ่งแยกชัดเจน

กฎเกณฑ์ทั้งหลายในสังคม ก็เป็นมนุษย์เป็นคนบัญญัติกติกาขึ้นมาเองแท้ๆ แต่ในเมื่อเราวางบรรทัดฐานทุกอย่างไว้ที่สองเพศ ชายหญิงเป็นหลัก มันได้ทำให้คนที่เป็นเพศที่ 3 วางตัวลำบากและต้องดิ้นรน

ใน ""รักข้างเดียว"" เราเห็นความกระเสือกกระสนของ LGBT ที่จะลบตัวตนและสร้างตัวตนขึ้นใหม่ เรื่องราวของคนข้ามเพศ ทั้งที่ ""ข้าม"" ได้และข้ามไม่ได้ และมันไม่ใช่แค่เรื่องการศัลยกรรมหรือไม่ศัลยกรรม แต่ไปไกลกว่านั้น

พอมองว่า ""รักข้างเดียว"" ถูกเขียนขึ้นในปี 2001 หรือก็คือ 20 ปีก่อน
ก็รู้สึกว่า... เนื้อหายังใหม่และร่วมสมัยอย่างกับเขียนขึ้นเมื่อปีที่แล้วนี่เอง
ผลงานยุคเดียวกันกับ ความลับ พระอาทิตย์เที่ยงคืน ความลับใต้ทะเลสาป เกมรักพาตัว และจดหมายจากฆาตกร

อ่าน ""รักข้างเดียว"" แล้วเปิดโลก LGBT มากกกกก ว่า... มันมีสิ่งที่เรายังไม่รู้อีกมากมายจริงๆ
อ่านๆ ไป... ก็สับสนจังว่า... จริงๆ แล้วเพศคืออะไรกันแน่ เราจะใช้อะไรเป็นเกณฑ์วัดล่ะ?
คืออวัยวะเพศ?
คือโครโมโซมเพศ?
คือเพศของคนที่ตัวเองรักชอบ?
คือพฤติกรรมที่สังคมบ่งว่าแยกเพศชัดเจน? เช่น ชอบสีฟ้าหรือสีชมพู ใส่กางเกงหรือกระโปรง ใส่ส้นสูงหรือรองเท้ากีฬา

เล่มนี้แม้เขียนมายี่สิบปีแต่ประเด็นหลักของเรื่องยังทันสมัยอยู่เลย เรื่องเพศสภาพ เพศทางเลือก การแบ่งผู้หญิง ผู้ชาย จริงๆแล้วนิยามของคำว่าผู้หญิงและผู้ชายคืออะไร จุดตัดอยู่ตรงไหน จำเป็นมั้ยที่เราต้องให้นิยามเพศอย่างชัดเจนขนาดนั้น มีผู้คนมากมายที่ต้องทุกข์ทรมานกับคำนิยามเหล่านี้ ทำอย่างไรจึงจะหลุดพ้นจากกรอบนี้ได้

ชอบการเปรียบเทียบความเป็นผู้หญิง ผู้ชายบนแถบเมอบิอุส (แถบขาวบนหน้าปกนั่นแหละ) เพราะไม่ว่าเราออกเดินทางตรงจุดไหน สุดท้ายมันก็จะมาบรรจบกันอยู่บนด้านเดียวกันเสมอ

ประเด็นเพศทางเลือกนี้คุณเคโงะนำมาผูกเป็นนิยายผ่านกลุ่มเพื่อนรักทีมอเมริกันฟุตบอลสมัยมหาวิทยาลัย ซึ่งการเลือกกีฬานี้ขึ้นมาไม่ได้เลือกมามั่วๆ ภายหลังแม้ต่างคนต่างแยกย้ายกันทำงานแต่ต่างฝ่ายต่างทำหน้าที่เดิมให้กันและกัน อ่านเกมส์ รับลูก ป้องกันลูก ส่งลูก แต่เมื่อมีสมาชิกในทีมฆ่าคนตายซึ่งเป็นเพื่อนผู้หญิงแต่จิตใจเป็นผู้ชาย สมาชิกในทีมต่างเลือกทำหน้าที่แตกต่างกัน มีคนที่ตามกัดไม่ปล่อย คนที่ถอยออกมาดูห่างๆ คนที่คุมเกมส์รอจังหวะ แต่ยิ่งขุดลึกกลับยิ่งซับซ้อน เกี่ยวพันไปถึงการสลับทะเบียนราษฎร์เปลี่ยนความเป็นหญิงชาย เพื่อนสนิทเริ่มเดือดร้อน สุดท้ายแล้วเรื่องราวที่เกิดขึ้นได้เปลี่ยนกลุ่มเพื่อนเหล่านี้ไปตลอดกาล",5,8 likes,17

เป็นเล่มที่มีความซับซ้อน และใช้พลังในการอ่านมากทีเดียว
นิยายเรื่องยาวสัญชาติญี่ปุ่นของนักเขียนคนโปรด Higashino Keigo เล่มนี้ เล่นประเด็นทางสังคมที่ทันสมัย ตาม trend ของโลก และที่สำคัญคือถูกจริตมาก นั่นคือเรื่อง LGBTQ
Keigo นำประเด็น LGBTQ ในประเทศญี่ปุ่นมาขยี้ให้เห็นโลกอีกใบหนึ่งที่ดำเนินคู่ขนานไปกับญี่ปุ่นที่ใครๆ เห็น

เปิดเรื่องด้วยการรวมรุ่นของเหล่าเพื่อนักกีฬาอเมริกันฟุตบอลไฮสคูล ในวัยที่ออกทำงานหาเลี้ยงชีพ มีชีวิตครอบครัวกันแล้ว แต่หนึ่งในผู้จัดการทีมหญิงกลับปรากฏตัวหลังงานในรูปลักษณ์ที่เปลี่ยนแปลงไป เพราะใจเธอเป็นชายเพียงแต่กายเป็นหญิง และที่สำคัญเธอมาพ้อมกับคำสารภาพว่าเธอเพิ่งก่อคดีฆาตกรรม ฆ่าชายโรคจิตที่มาตาม stalk เพื่อนสาวของเธอ
ตัวเอกของเรื่องเป็นชายหนุ่มอดีต quarterback ของทีม ที่ปัจจุบันเป็นนักข่าวสายกีฬา และเป็นเพื่อนที่เธอไว้ใจ พยายามที่จะอำพราง ปิดบังคดีนี้ ไม่ให้เธอถูกจับ อีกใจนึงก็เชื่อครึ่งไม่เชื่อครึ่งว่าเธอเป็นฆาตกร จึงลงมือสืบคดีค้นหาความจริงด้วยตัวเอง แต่สิ่งที่พบกลับกลายเป็นเรื่องราวที่สุดซับซ้อน จนถึงขั้นที่อ่านไปแล้วต้องหยิบกระดาษมาทด shortnote เอาไว้ นั่นคือโลกของ LGBTQ ในญี่ปุ่น

เรารู้กันดีว่าญี่ปุ่นเป็นสังคมรวมหมู่ แม้จะเหมือนว่าต่างคนต่างอยู่มีความเป็นปัจเจกสูง แต่กลับแทบจะไม่ยอมรับความแตกต่างแปลกแยก เรียกได้ว่าความเป็น LGBTQ เป็นสิ่งแปลกปลอม
นอกจากนี้ยังมีการกดเพศหญิงอย่างที่รู้กันว่า officelady ได้เงินเดือนน้อยกว่า salaryman ขนาดผู้หญิงยังถูกกด แล้ว LGBTQ นี่จะเหลือหรือ

สิ่งที่ Keigo ทำคือนำเอาชีวิตและโลกของคนกลุ่มนี้ขึ้นมาเล่า ผ่านงานสไตล์สืบสวนสอบสวน บวกกับดราม่าความสัมพันธ์ที่เข้มข้น ระหว่างที่อ่านไปจะรู้เลยว่าตัวละครในเรื่องนี้ออกสีเทาๆ ทุกตัว เหมือนกับ spectrum ทางเพศ ที่เป็นเฉดสีไม่ใช่สีขาวหรือสีดำ
Keigo เดินเรื่องอย่างมีชั้นเชิงมาก ในส่วนของสืบสวนสอบสวน แม้จะดูเนิบๆ แต่มันจะมีความรู้สึกตะหงิดๆ ตลอดว่า เฮ้ย ใช่เหรอ มันต้องมีเบื้องหลัง มีความลับซ่อนอยู่แน่ๆ ในส่วนของดราม่านี่แทบไม่ต้อง said เพราะชั้นเชิงระดับเทพ ทำให้เรามีความเข้าใจและ empathy ตัวละครได้จริงๆ

หนังสือหนาถูกใจ ใช้เวลาอ่านและสมาธิมากกว่างานชิ้นอื่นๆ แต่อิ่มกับดราม่า และอินกับประเด็น LGBTQ
และเป็นอีกครั้งที่อ่านแล้วรู้สึกว่า Keigo ต่อสู้เพื่อประเด็นทางสังคมในระดับปัจเจกด้วยวิธีการของตัวเอง
ขอบอกเลยว่าประเด็นเรื่อง gender เป็นประเด็นที่จำเพาะและมีความ sensitive ดังนั้น นักอ่านบางท่านอาจจะไม่อิน ไม่ถูกใจ แต่ว่าการได้รับรู้เรื่องราวว่ามีเรื่องแบบนี้ในโลก แม้กระทั่งเป็นโลกอีกใบที่เราไม่มีทางเข้าถึง ก็เป็นสิ่งที่หนังสือนิยายมอบให้คนอ่านได้เสมอมิใช่หรือ

ที่จริงช่วงนี้อ่านหนังสือหนักไปทางแนวประวัติศาสตร์และการเมืองค่อนข้างเยอะ แต่พอได้หนังสือเล่มนี้มาก็อดที่จะเปิดอ่านไม่ได้จริงๆ กะว่าจะลองเปิดหน้าแรกอ่านคำนำดูก่อนว่าเป็นแนวไหน ดันไม่เจอคำนำ เลยต้องอ่านซักนิดดูโทนของเรื่อง ปรากฏว่า เฮ้ย หนังสือเล่มนี้เขียนถึงเรื่อง LGBTQ ที่ไปไกลมากในญี่ปุ่น
เข้าใจนะว่าคนญี่ปุ่นเวลาทำอะไรแล้วทำสุด แต่ความสุดของประเด็นการต่อสู้เพื่ออิสรภาพ เสรีภาพของ LGBTQ มันเกินจินตนาการของคนที่อยู่ในกะลาแคบๆ
กลายเป็นว่านิยายของมหาเทพ Keigo เล่มนี้ มันสอดคล้องกับ movement ของทั้งประเทศไทยและของโลก และแน่นอนว่า #ถ้าการเมืองดี เราจะได้เห็นเสรีภาพทาง gender แน่นอน
เพราะเสรีภาพทางเพศสภาพ คือเครื่องวัดระดับเสรีภาพของคนในสังคม

review_4353885740,Thanh Hang NGUYEN,"Nov 24, 2021","Tác phẩm này là một trong những quyển đúng chất Keigo Higashino: vừa có tình tiết án mạng-trinh thám, vừa đề cập đến vấn đề xã hội và cảm xúc nhân vật.

Nội dung nói về hiện tượng rối loạn nhận diện giới tính và liên giới tính - một vấn đề mà xã hội vẫn bỏ ngỏ, thờ ơ và phân biệt đối xử. Cộng đồng những người rối loạn nhận diện giới tính và liên giới tính tìm cách tồn tại bằng cách liên kết với nhau để định nghĩa lại số phận của bản thân. Và nhân vật Mitsuki - một cô bạn giỏi giang của nhóm Tetsuro - một ngày đã thú nhận mình là nam dù mang giới tính nữ, và vừa giết người.

Câu chuyện diễn biến ngày càng phức tạp hơn vì các nhân vật chính đi sâu vào 1 trong những cộng đồng nhiều bí mật nhất trong xã hội. Câu hỏi được đặt ra nhiều lần trong truyện là: Định nghĩa “con trai-con gái” là gì? Điều gì xác định một người là nam hay là nữ ngoài bộ nhiễm sắc thể XX, XY? Nếu một người mang nhiễm sắc thể của giới này nhưng tâm hồn và khao khát của giới kia thì là gì?

Nội dung khá hấp dẫn và đưa ra những suy nghĩ về 1 thực trạng xã hội. Mình thấy đây là 1 truyện giải trí ổn.",4,4 likes,17

Đây mới đích thị là tác phẩm xứng tầm ngòi bút của Keigo. Nhắc đến Keigo người ta nhớ đến 1 Bạch Dạ Hành tuyệt tác, 1 Bí mật của Naoko sâu sắc, 1 Phía sau nghi can X đầy bất ngờ thế nhưng với mình Đơn Phương mới chính là màu sắc mà mình mong chờ từ Keigo xứng đáng lọt vào hàng tuyệt tác của ông. Vốn dĩ ban đầu mình thấy nó được rate có 3.84☆ thôi nên chắc mẩm đây là 1 cuốn sách trung bình của Keigo nhưng khi đọc đến những chữ cuối cùng mình mới thấy nhận định sai lầm hoàn toàn. Vì sao ư? Vì Đơn phương nó xuất sắc ngoài sự mong đợi của mình. Cách đặt vấn đề mào đầu tác phẩm quá ổn. Những cú plot twist mình không thể nào đoán được. Thật sự mọi lần đọc Keigo mình mang máng hình dung được cốt truyện nhưng với Đơn phương mình kiểu bị lạc lối hoàn toàn trong câu chữ của Keigo. Tình tiết nó đan xen rối rắm nhưng rất logic và làm mình hồi hộp đến phút cuối cùng. Quan trọng nhất cái làm nên sự thành công tuyệt đối của tác phẩm đối với cá nhân mình chính là vấn đề giới tính mà Keigo đưa vào tác phẩm. Nó trần trụi đến đáng thương nhưng cũng thực tế và khắc nghiệt vô cùng. Đỉnh cao chính là cuộc trò chuyện giữa Tetsuro và Aikawa. Đắt giá đến từng thớ chữ ấy. Có 1 vài đoạn mình thấy thấm thía cực kỳ.
""Trên đời này không tồn tại chứng rối loạn nhân diện giới tính. Đối tượng cần điều trị chính là bộ phận xã hội có cách nhìn nhận vấn đề như thế thì đúng hơn.""
""Con người vốn dĩ hay sợ hãi những thứ mà mình chưa biết rõ. Vì sợ nên mới cố loại bỏ chúng....Bản thân trong suy nghĩ đã không có ý định tiếp nhận thì truyền tải kiểu gì cũng vô ích. Tình yêu một chiều vì thế mới kéo dài mãi.""
Hay là
""Tại sao rất nhiều người lại bị hạn chế trong sự phân chia NST giới tính? Tại sao họ không thể nghĩ rằng dù có là XX hay XY hay một loại gì đó khác thì bản chất con người vẫn không có gì thay đổi?""
Tựu chung mình đánh giá đây là tác phẩm xứng đáng liệt vào hàng tuyệt tác của Keigo. Tổng thể là một sự hòa trộn hoàn hảo của trinh thám, tâm lý, thanh xuân tuổi trẻ và gắn với vấn đề giới tính. Đọc tác phẩm mới thấy 1 Higashino Keigo điêu luyện trong ngòi bút và luôn có một tầm nhìn vượt thời đại.

Lúc mình thấy tựa sách mình đã tưởng đây chỉ là một câu chuyện tình yêu đơn thuần nhưng không. Đây là quyển sách chứa đựng thông điệp sâu sắc về giới tính, về ranh giới giữa con trai và con gái thậm chí là xoá đi ranh giới mỏng manh đó. Chúng ta ai cũng ở trên dải Mobius nhưng chỉ là chúng ta không nhận ra mà thôi hoặc là chúng ta đang chối bỏ nó. Mình đã có cái nhìn khách quan và chân thật hơn về giới tính và đặc biệt là những định kiến về giới tính mà chúng ta thường áp đặt lên người khác. Và đây còn là câu chuyện về tình bạn, những người bạn đã trở thành một phần trong thanh xuân của nhau. Tất nhiên chuyện vẫn có yếu tố trinh thám nhưng bản thân mình thấy yếu tố trinh thám chỉ để góp phần làm nổi bật thông điệp mà tác giả muốn truyền tải cho người đọc. Và dù bạn là ai thì vẫn nên đọc cuốn này một lần trong đời để có thể hiểu chính mình và hiểu hơn những người thuộc cộng đồng lgbt để có cái nhìn đẹp hơn về họ.",4,2 likes,17

Đơn Phương cũng không là ngoại lệ. “Thân thể của con gái nhưng tâm hồn là con trai”, mình đã mua cuốn sách này vì những dòng chữ ấy. Vấn đề giới tính là một vấn đề mình quan tâm và phải nói rằng mình đồng ý với cách suy nghĩ của Keigo được thể hiện qua cuốn sách này.
Nếu nói đây là một cuốn sách trinh thám thì mình không đồng ý lắm, yếu tố trinh thám chiếm một tỉ lệ nhỏ trong câu chuyện này nhưng cách kể chuyện logic làm mọi thứ kết nối một cách kỳ lạ của Keigo vẫn còn đó.
“Con người vốn dĩ hay sợ hãi những thứ mình chưa biết rõ. Vì sợ nên mới cố loại bỏ chúng. Dù thuật ngữ “chứng rối loạn nhận diện giới tính” ngày một trở nên phổ biến đi nữa thì vẫn không có gì thay đổi. Bản thân trong suy nghĩ đã không có ý định tiếp nhận thì truyền tải kiểu gì cũng vô ích. Tình yêu một chiều có lẽ sẽ còn tiếp tục kéo dài.” Đây là một câu mình rất tâm đắc trong tác phẩm, nó thật sự đã lý giải được những câu hỏi mà mình đang có về nhiều vấn đề.
Cuối cùng mình chỉ muốn nói “Một tuyệt tác trinh thám viết về những người bạn thân đã cùng trải qua một thời thanh xuân không bao giờ phản bội nhau” là câu nói rõ nhất để chỉ tình tiết câu chuyện (mình không biết đây có được tính là spoiler không nữa).",5,2 likes,17

ตลอดเวลาที่อ่าน แบ่งเป็นสองความรู้สึกใหญ่ๆ คือ 1.สนุกกับเนื้อเรื่อง การได้ลุ้นตามหาความจริงไปพร้อมกับตัวละคร เป็นอะไรที่เรารักมากในหนังสือของอ.เคโงะอยู่แล้ว และ 2.ความรู้สึกหนักๆ ในประเด็นเรื่องเพศที่เป็นสิ่งสำคัญของเรื่อง เราอ่านด้วยความอึดอัด เจ็บปวด เสียใจ ยิ่งได้รู้ว่าหนังสือเล่มนี้ตีพิมพ์ครั้งแรกเมื่อปี 2001 ยิ่งรู้สึกเศร้า คือมันผ่านมาแล้ว 20 ปี แต่เหมือนเพิ่งเขียนเมื่อวานนี้เอง เป็นอีกเครื่องมือชี้วัดว่าเรื่องนี้ในสังคมมันไม่เคยก้าวหน้าไปไหนเลย 😢

เราชอบหลายอย่างที่ใส่มาในเล่มนี้มากๆ ปกติแล้วไม่ค่อยชอบเรื่องกัฬาเพราะรู้สึกว่ากติกามันเข้าใจยาก มันเห็นภาพไม่ค่อยชัดด้วยการอ่าน แต่เรื่องนี้เราประทับใจมากจริงๆ มันผูกโยงกับตัวละครทุกตัวได้ดีมากๆๆ และประทับใจทุกตัวละครที่ทำให้หนังสือเล่มนี้สมบูรณ์ได้ขนาดนี้ ถึงบางตัวละครจะโผล่ออกมารวมกันไม่ถึง 1 หน้ากระดาษ แต่มันมีความกินใจมากจริงๆ ทุกตัวอักษรที่ได้ผ่านเข้ามาในสายตามันทำให้เราได้อะไรกลับมาเยอะมาก ทำให้ตระหนักในเรื่อง LGBTQ+ มากขึ้นว่ามันมีอะไรมากกว่าที่เราคิดว่าเข้าใจแล้ว หนังสือเล่มนี้มันพาเราเข้าไปอยู่ในความรู้สึกที่ลึกลงไปกว่านั้นอีกนิดนึง อ่านไปด้วยคิดตามไปด้วย โอ่ย พูดยาก เราอธิบายอะไรที่มันมีสาระไม่ค่อยได้ T_T แต่หนังสือเล่มนี้ดีมากจริงๆ การดำเนินเรื่อง+ประเด็น ดึงดูดให้อ่านได้รวดเดียวจบ แต่ต้องสารภาพจริงๆ ว่าตัวละครเยอะเลื้อเกิน แล้วไหนจะตำแหน่งนั่นนี่ในทีม อ่านจบก็หมดพลังไปเยอะพอสมควร

ปล.ทีแรกก็สงสัยว่าทำไมคำนำสำนักพิมพ์/ผู้แปลถึงไปอยู่ท้ายเล่ม แต่คิดว่าต้องมีเหตุผลแหละ พออ่านจบแล้วก็อ๋อ เพราะแบบนี้นี่เอง!

อีกปล.ชอบชื่อ ‘รักข้างเดียว’ มากๆ เพราะชื่อเรื่องมันเป็นคำตอบของหลายๆคำถามที่เราตั้งขึ้นมาในหัวขณะอ่านจนถึงตอนจบเลย

อีกปลล.มีเซอไพรส์เล็กๆ ซ่อนอยู่ในหนังสือเล่มนี้ด้วย ตอนอ่านเจอเราตื่นเต้นมากกกก :}",4,3 likes,17

Mention: chứng rối loạn nhận diện giới tính, những con người có cùng vấn đề đó, và một hội bạn từng trong câu lạc bộ bóng bầu dục mỹ của trường. Đọc phần bình luận ở cuối thì đó là 2 chủ đề tác giả quan tâm tại thời điểm viết nên đưa vào vậy đó :D

Review: Mình cảm thấy tác phẩm này của bác Keigo hơi dài dòng, có đôi chỗ lan man mà đến khi đọc xong truyện mình cũng chưa ngẫm ra được ẩn ý hay ý đồ truyền tải của tác giả. Tuy nhiên phần cuối truyện thì hay hơn và đưa ra suy ngẫm thú vị về “con trai”, “con gái”, cách nhìn nhận về “tính nam tính nữ”, cùng với đó là câu chuyện cảm động về tình bạn, tình cảm “đơn phương” nữa.
Mình thấy phần bình ở cuối sách là một điểm cộng vì người bình đã đem đến góc nhìn rõ ràng hơn cho các hình ảnh, chi tiết trong truyện, nhờ đọc phần bình này mà mình mới hiểu hơn nội dung truyện ý :D Có hai đoạn ở phần bình mình thấy hay mà cũng là chủ đề chính của cuốn truyện luôn:
""Thật và giả, thiện và ác, đẹp và xấu, thỉnh thoảng con người tiếp nhận chúng bằng cách tách ra làm hai phần. Bản thân hy vọng mình đang làm điều đúng đắn nhưng thực tế đâu có đơn giản như thế. Nó còn tùy thuộc vào việc ánh sáng đang soi rọi phần nào, không thể diễn đạt hết ý chỉ bằng một câu nói, khi yếu tố mâu thuẫn luôn đi kèm bên cạnh. Nhiều phương diện và đầy mơ hồ. Cuộc đời của con người quả thật như đang đi bộ trên dải ""Mobius"". Và luôn ""yêu thầm"" phía đối diện đầy bí ẩn ấy.""


”Một người không thể lưu lại một nơi quá lâu. Sự gần gũi không phải lúc nào cũng giúp hai người kết nối tình cảm.""

2. อเมริกันฟุตบอล : อันนี้เหตุผลส่วนตัวมากๆ ค่ะ 5555 เพราะชอบอเมริกันฟุตบอลเป็นทุนเดิมอยู่แล้ว พอได้อ่านตัวละครหลักเล่นอเมริกันฟุตบอล มีการพูดถึงแทคติก ตำแหน่งต่างๆ แล้วคิดถึงมากเลยค่ะ เหมือนเจอเพื่อนเก่า

3. บรรยายความนึกคิดตัวละครหลักเยอะมาก เล่มหนากว่าเล่มอื่นๆ อย่างเห็นได้ชัด ไม่ใช่เพราะการสืบสวนหรอก (ส่วนนึงแหละ) แต่พอเป็นเรื่องเพศสภาพการบรรยายจิตใจก็สำคัญ บางคนอาจจะไม่ชอบก็ได้ค่ะ

“Đơn phương” là 1 câu chuyện đẹp về tình yêu, tình bạn và xoay quanh vấn đề muôn thuở về giới tính, phù hợp với hoàn cảnh LGBT ngày càng được nhiều sự quan tâm như hiện nay. “Đơn phương” dấy lên câu hỏi về giới tính trong mỗi con người. Thế nào là con gái? Thế nào là con trai?
Con trai được “định nghĩa” những cá nhân mang nhiễm sắc thể XY, có tinh hoàn, thân hình cơ bắp và khỏe khoắn. Con gái thì mang nhiễm sắc thể XX, có buồng trứng, ngực phát triển, cơ thể thì nữ tính và mềm mỏng. Theo phương diện y học của cơ thể thì đúng là như vậy, nhưng còn tâm hồn thì sao? Liệu định nghĩa đó có đầy đủ, hay còn hiệu nghiệm trong cái xã hội hiện nay khi mà người ta có nhiều sự lựa chọn hơn?

“Đơn phương” đã phần nào giải đáp được câu hỏi này. Con trai và con gái giống như mặt trên và mặt dưới của dải mobius. Dải mobius được hình thành bằng cách xoắn 1 mảnh vải và dán 2 đầu lại vào nhau tạo thành 1 vòng tròn xoắn, hay nói cách khác, không hề tồn tại mặt trên và mặt dưới trong 1 mảnh vải mobius. Dù có xoay hay uốn nắn cỡ nào thì độc nhất cũng chỉ có 1 mặt. Con trai và con gái là như vậy. Không ai hoàn toàn là nam và cũng không ai hoàn toàn là nữ. Tâm hồn nam tính và nữ tính của chúng ta sẽ như con lắc dao động qua lại trên dải mobius, nên việc cố vạch ra ranh giới nam nữ 1 cách rạch ròi là điều vô nghĩa, càng vô nghĩa hơn khi bạn áp đặt nhận định cá nhân của mình lên người khác.
Tác giả đã nói rất đúng, đáng lẽ ra không có chứng bệnh gọi là rối loạn nhận diện giới tính, tất cả cũng là do xã hội đã áp đặt cách nhìn về giới tính theo 2 mặt lên mỗi người, khiến 1 số người lầm tưởng rằng mình đang tồn tại không đúng bản chất. Một phát hiện rất hay và cũng là 1 thử thách mới trong nhận thức cho chúng ta.

“Đơn phương” ở trong câu chuyện tượng trưng cho nhiều thứ. Những người bị rối loạn về giới tính muốn được chấp nhận nhưng xã hội đã từ chối họ, hệt như 1 người đơn phương truyền tải tình cảm đến 1 người không hề hiểu mình. Sự đơn phương đó còn thể hiện qua tình cảm của Tetsuro và Naoko đối với Mitsuki, cũng như Mitsuki đã đơn phương thích Risako. Tình yêu đơn phương to lớn của Naoko đã dẫn dắt anh qua khỏi rào cản về giới tính để yêu lấy tâm hồn nữ tính và cả nam tính của Mitsuki. Đoạn cuối rất cảm động khi Naoko quyết định trao cho Mitsuki danh phận con trai của anh để cô có thể sống đúng với tâm hồn của mình. Buồn lắm khi Naoko ra đi nhưng sự quyết tâm và hoàn cảnh của anh khiến mình tin quyết định đó là đúng đắn.

Khúc cuối không rõ là Mitsuki đã dùng danh phận của Naoko, hay của Risako, hay đã dùng danh phận của Naoko và sống với Risako. Quả không hổ danh là Keigo Higashino. Những cái kết thúc mở của ông luôn có tác động mạnh đến độc giả. Tác phẩm đã cho mình thấy 1 góc khuất của xã hội mà mình chưa hề nghĩ đến, cũng như đã thay đổi phần nào đó suy nghĩ của mình về vấn đề giới tính. Một tác phẩm rất thú vị và đáng đọc.

Đơn phương bắt đầu câu chuyện với nhân vật Mitsuki- nhân vật mang cơ thể của con gái nhưng tâm hồn lại của con trai. Vụ án xoay quanh nhân vật này và những người bạn trong đội bóng bầu dục Mỹ của cô đã mở ra nhiều câu chuyện về thân phận và câu hỏi lớn về giới tính: Liệu có tồn tại thực sự một ranh giới rõ ràng giữa nam và nữ? Liệu ngoài mã gen và những khác biệt sinh học ra, điều gì quyết định con người phải sống đúng với giới tính của mình?

Truyện có hai tuyến nhân vật rất rõ ràng: tuyến nhân vật “tạo vấn đề” và tuyến nhân vật “giải quyết vấn đề”. Truyện kể ở góc nhìn của Tetsuro và hành trình “giải quyết vấn đề” của nhân vật. Trong hành trình theo đuổi vụ án của Mitsuki, người đọc cùng Tetsuro khám phá ra những sự thật đau lòng được ẩn giấu đằng sau tấm thẻ “căn cước”. Chúng ta vẫn hay nói về “cái tôi”, “bản ngã”, “được là chính mình”, những điều đó quả thực rất xa vời và khó khăn với những nhân vật trong truyện. Họ khao khát được sống với đúng bản ngã, họ sợ hãi trước ánh nhìn phán xét của xã hội, họ mâu thuẫn và giằng xé với chính bản thân mình. Có biết bao nhiêu người đang phải sống một cuộc sống của người khác- một cuộc sống phù hợp với dáng vẻ bên ngoài? Tại sao con gái phải thích mặc váy, chơi búp bê còn con trai phải thích chơi thể thao và không được phép yếu đuối? Điều gì đã mặc định như thế? Chẳng phải tất cả đều là những định kiến xã hội hay sao?

Một hình ảnh đặc biệt được Higashino Keigo sử dụng trong sách mà mình rất thích: đó là dải băng Mobius (Mình thậm chí còn tra cứu Wiki và thí nghiệm thực tế về dải băng này :)) )
“Toàn bộ con người trên thế giới đều ở trên dải Mobius. Không có ai hoàn toàn là nam và cũng không có ai hoàn toàn là nữ. Một người bình thường sẽ có đoạn này là nam, nhưng ở đoạn khác là nữ.”

Với cá nhân, mình hoàn toàn ủng hộ chủ kiến này. Không ai “men” 100% và cũng không ai nữ tính 100%. Cả cuộc đời mỗi người đều như đang đi trên dải băng Mobius ấy, đơn phương yêu thầm chính bản ngã đối diện đầy bí ẩn của mình.

Bản chất con người vốn dĩ sợ hãi những gì chúng ta chưa biết rõ, và thật khó để chấp nhận những gì khác với chúng ta. Đặt trong bối cảnh 20 năm trước, tác giả đã tái hiện rõ nét một xã hội Nhật Bản tuy văn minh, tiến bộ nhưng cũng chứa đầy định kiến. Không chỉ định kiến với những người có chứng “rối loạn nhận diện giới tính” (theo cách gọi được đề cập đến trong sách- bản thân cách gọi này đã chứa đầy sự phán xét) mà còn là định kiến giữa nam và nữ. Mọi hành động của Tetsuro, dù vô thức nhưng cũng ẩn chứa định kiến và phân biệt giới với người vợ Risako của mình. Câu chuyện hôn nhân giữa hai người được lồng ghép khéo léo trong suốt mạch truyện cũng phần nào nói lên được thực trạng hôn nhân trong xã hội hiện đại Nhật Bản.

CÂU CHUYỆN VỀ TÌNH BẠN

Ngoài yếu tố trinh thám và vấn đề về giới, điểm mình yêu thích ở tác phẩm này là câu chuyện tình bạn giữa một nhóm bạn thời Đại học với nhau. Bạn đã bao giờ có tình bạn nào đáng để đánh đổi mọi thứ? Họ là những người chơi chung một đội bóng, chia sẻ một quãng thanh xuân cùng nhau, và dù chẳng mấy khi có cơ hội gặp gỡ nhưng khi xảy ra chuyện thì sẵn sàng làm mọi thứ để bảo vệ bạn của mình. Điều đáng tiếc ở đây là mình không có chút kiến thức nào về bộ môn bóng bầu dục Mỹ, nếu không ắt hẳn những đoạn hồi tưởng về trận đấu và vị trí chơi của mỗi nhân vật cũng sẽ mang đến những liên tưởng hấp dẫn.

“Tình bạn không phải là thứ cậu có thể dễ dàng cắt đứt như thế, cũng không phải là thứ cậu có thể tuỳ ý cắt đứt hay hàn gắn tuỳ thuộc hoàn cảnh của mình. Tớ sẽ không để cậu chạy trốn chỉ vì cảm thấy mối quan hệ ấy đầy rẫy phiền phức đâu. Cậu hãy tự nhận lấy trách nhiệm của một người bạn đi.”

Với mình, tất cả những gì Đơn phương của Higashino Keigo truyền tải 20 năm trước vẫn còn nguyên vẹn giá trị cho đến ngày hôm nay. Và như đặc trưng trong tiểu thuyết của ông: thiện- ác, trắng- đen, đúng- sai.. là những thứ không phải lúc nào cũng có thể phân biệt rạch ròi. Cuộc sống muôn màu muôn vẻ và sẽ chẳng có gì là tuyệt đối, vậy tại sao không cởi mở suy nghĩ và rộng lòng bao dung yêu thương tất thảy những thứ thuộc về con người?

⭐ Mọt vừa trải qua 1 kỳ thi cực kỳ, cực kỳ quan trọng... cảm giác y như ngày trước đi thi Đại Học vậy á. Thi xong thì Mọt nhật được kết quả cũng khá khả quan nên đã tự thưởng cho bản thân 1 chuyến Đà Lạt vì những cố gắng của mình. Eo ôi Đà Lạt xuống còn 14 độ lạnh chết được. Nhờ chuyến đi Đà Lạt này Mọt mới nhận ra cơ thể Mọt cũng chẳng khoẻ đến vậy phải tập luyện thể dục thêm thôi.

⭐ Sài Gòn mùa này lạnh hơn những gì Sài Gòn có cậu ạ cái thời tiết này lại làm Mọt bỏ một ngày ra pha 1 ấm trà nóng ôm sách, trùm mềm mà đọc ngấu nghiến. Hôm nay là Đơn Phương củ Keigo đã đồng hành cùng Mọt.

⭐ Lúc đầu Mọt cứ ngỡ nó sẽ là một quyển sách kiểu cho Mọt ăn cẩu lương và có chút trinh thám cho đến khi đọc nửa quyển nhìn lại mới biết tác giả là Keigo nên quyển sách mới đau lòng đến vậy.

⭐ Thân thể là con gái, nhưng tâm hồn là con trai. Đau khổ chịu đựng suốt gần ba mươi năm, đến khi có cơ hội sống đúng với bản chất của mình thì Mitsuki lại vô tình dính vào một vụ giết người ngang trái. Đầu thú hay bỏ trốn? Trước khi đưa ra quyết định cuối cùng, Mitsuki muốn gặp lại những người bạn đại học đã cùng cô chia sẻ tuổi thanh xuân nồng nhiệt. Tetsuro cùng vợ mình, đồng thời là bạn thân của Mitsuki, quyết định giúp đỡ cô, nhưng… Phải chăng khoảng thời gian mười năm đã khiến tình bạn của họ, thậm chí cả bản thân họ, thay đổi hay từ đầu tình bạn ấy đã chẳng cao đẹp đến vậy...

⭐ Đơn Phương làm cho Mọt phải thốt lên rằng nếu là một ai đó khác có lẽ màu chuyện sẽ không hoàn hảo đến vậy. Sự thực về xã hội đan xen giữa những đấu tranh nội tâm của nhân vật tạo nên một bức tranh chẳng biết đâu là đường. Một lần nữa, tài hoa bậc thầy của Keigo Higashino đã đưa một tác phẩm hay lên tầm tuyệt tác.

⭐ Mọt không thể kể cho cậu nghe về quyển sách này một cách thấu hiểu hơn trừ phi cậu đọc nó và cùng Mọt cảm nhận từng câu chữ dưới trang sách . Hãy đọc để ngắm nhìn bức tranh tổng thể của riêng cậu và đón nhận những góc khuất mà chỉ cậu mới có thể hiểu rõ.",0,0 likes,17
review_4679082631,Đặng Nhật Vũ,"Apr 26, 2022","** spoiler alert ** *Tóm tắt nội dung:
Mistsuki là một người mang thân thể con gái nhưng tâm hồn con trai. Một ngày nọ, cô vô tình trở thành hung thủ giết người. Trước khi đầu thú, cô quyết định gặp lại những người bạn trung học trong đội bóng chày. Tuy nhiên, những người bạn cùng trải qua quãng thời gian thanh xuân tươi đẹp quyết định giúp cô tìm cách thoát tội.
Mistuki tạm trú ngụ ở nhà của vợ chống Tetsuro và Risako. Từ đó, những quan điểm của những người trai “thẳng”, gái “thẳng” về người đồng tính được bộc lộ. Tetsuro trong quá trính điều tra vụ án mạng cũng đã đi sâu tìm hiểu về cộng đồng LGBTQ+ và tác giả thông qua đó mô tả những khó khăn, định kiến xã hội mà những người thuộc cộng đồng phải trải qua. Cách họ vượt qua nỗi đau thể xác, đối mặt với phụ huynh, với con cái, với bạn bè, với các mối quan hệ xã hội khác, trong thể thao, cũng như cách thể hiện giới tính trong các giấy tờ định danh và hộ tịch.
Cái kết buồn nhưng tương đối trọn vẹn cho cộng đồng. Câu hỏi mở ra cuối cùng là: Sau quá trình “thoát xác”, họ có thể được cuộc sống như người bình thường hay không?
*Điểm hay:
- Văn phong mạch lạc, tình tiết không quá nhanh nhưng đủ lôi kéo người đọc qua hơn 500 trang sách.
- Nhiều vấn đề trong cộng đồng được nêu ra và giải thích. Lưu ý là cuốn này được ra mắt vào năm 2001, hơn 20 năm về trước.
- Hệ thống nhân vật trong cuốn này siêu hay, kể cả những nhân vật rất phụ cũng có câu chuyện riêng, cá tính được khắc họa rõ nét.
* Điểm chưa hay:
- Phần nội dung trinh thám khá dễ đoán, không quá bất ngờ.
- Những hành động của Risako theo mình thấy khá là ức chế.
- Ngoài ra, tác giả đưa ra một nhân vật có khả năng “nhìn thấu” những người thuộc cộng đồng, cho dù họ đã chuyển giới. Vài lần trong sách, quan điểm người chuyển giới dù cố gắng thế nào cũng không thể giống được như đó là giới tính gốc của họ.",4,0 likes,17
review_3179890576,KV,"Feb 17, 2020","Mitsuki với hình hài là con gái nhưng lại mang tâm hồn của một người đàn ông, vô tình vướng vào một vụ giết người rắc rối. Mitsuki đã gặp lại Tetsuro, Risako, Sugai... là những người bạn thân trong đội bóng bầu dục Mỹ của trường đại học năm xưa, họ đã tình nguyện giúp đỡ cô giải quyết rắc rối này. Gặp lại nhau, họ đã cùng chia sẻ những câu chuyện của một thời thanh xuân nồng nhiệt với bao hoài bão, cảm xúc yêu đương thầm kín... Trong quá trình giúp đỡ Mitsuki, họ đã khám phá ra nhiều điều bí mật, đã gặp gỡ, tiếp xúc với rất nhiều những mảnh đời gặp vấn đề về giới tính mang những số phận ngang trái khác nhau. Mặt sau của vụ án là cả một ván cược đổi đời của những con người gặp khó khăn vì giới tính.

Vụ án chỉ là một cánh cửa để Keigo Higashino dẫn lối người đọc vào một câu chuyện nhiều màu sắc của những con người gặp vấn đề về giới tính của mình. Họ có thể mắc “chứng rối loạn nhận diện giới tính”, tuy thân thể là nam hoặc nữ nhưng tâm hồn thì ngược lại; rồi những trường hợp liên giới tính, phẫu thuật chuyển giới... Họ luôn khát khao được sống đúng với con người thật của chính mình, dù trong hình hài, tên tuổi nào đi nữa; dù cho có phải đánh đổi cả gia đình, người thân và cả tính mạng của chính mình đi nữa.

Đọc xong cuốn sách mình thấy đọng lại một cảm giác nặng trĩu, với những suy nghĩ về giới tính, giống như quan điểm mà tác giả đã đưa ra trong cuốn sách: “Không có ai hoàn toàn là nam và cũng không có ai hoàn toàn là nữ. Con người vốn dĩ hay sợ hãi những thứ mình chưa biết rõ. Vì sợ nên mới cố loại bỏ chúng. Dù thuật ngữ “chứng rối loạn nhận diện giới tính” ngày một phổ biến đi nữa thì vẫn không có gì thay đổi. Bản thân trong suy nghĩ đã không có ý định tiếp nhận thì truyền tải kiểu gì cũng vô ích.”",4,0 likes,17

คำเตือน: อาจมีสปอยเล็กน้อย
Kataomoi เป็นวรรณกรรมที่ผสมผสานระหว่างเรื่องของการสืบสวนฆาตกรรมและ coming of age โดยเล่าถึงกลุ่มเพื่อนชมรมอเมริกันฟุตบอลของมหาวิทยลัยเทโตะที่ได้เรียนจบมีงานมีการสร้างครอบครัวแล้วนัดเจอสังสรรค์กันจนกระทั่งการสังสรรค์ครั้งล่าสุด หลังจากจบงานเลี้ยง มิสึกิสมาชิกในชมรมที่ไม่ได้เข้าร่วมงานสังสรรค์ที่รออยู่ข้างนอกได้ก็ได้พบเพื่อนทั้ง 4 คนได้แก่ เท็ตซึโร, ซึไก,นากาโอะ, ริซาโกะ ก็ได้พูดถึงความจริงในใจว่าตลอดที่ผ่านมามี""เพศสภาพไม่ตรงกำเนิด"" และมีความลับนอกเหนือจากนั้น นั่นคือคดีฆาตกรรม ทำให้เท็ตสึโร่และเพื่อนต้องออกค้นหาและทำทุกวิถีทางเพื่อช่วยเหลือ มิสึกิ และได้พบเรื่องต่างๆมากมายและสิ่งที่คาดไม่ถึง

โดยเรื่องนั้นจะเล่าถึงผ่านตัวละครที่ชื่อเท็ตซึโอะ ที่เป็น cis gender ที่พยายามที่จะศึกษาและเข้าใจเพื่อน มิสึกิ โดยในเรื่องนั้นเท็ตซึโอะเองนอกจากพยายามค้นหาวิธีทางเพื่อช่วยเหลือมิสึกินั้น ยังพยายามที่จะเรียนรู้และพยายามที่จะเข้าใจเรื่องเพศหรือ gender โดยผ่านเหตุการณ์ต่างๆในเรื่องเช่น การทบทวนความสัมพันธ์ระหว่างเขากับภรรยา ริซาโกะที่แห้งแล้งอันเกิดจากการคิดอันที่ยึดติดในกรอบชาย-หญิงที่เกิดจากไม่ให้ความสำคัญในการพยายามที่จะเข้าใจ การพยายามที่จะเข้าใจปัญหาที่เกิดจากสังคมที่ไม่ยอมรับ การพยายามเรียนรู้ที่จะเข้าใจจากการได้พบปะพูดคุยกับคนอื่นๆหรือครอบครัวที่มีลูกเป็น lgbtq ความไม่ยอมรับของพ่อแม่กับลูกที่เป็นlgbtqที่ค่อยๆกัดกิดจิตใจของลูก เพื่อที่จะเข้าใจปัญหาและหาเบาะแสที่พอจะช่วยเหลือเพื่อนของเขาได้จนถึงที่สุด

แน่นอนว่าเนื้อหาในเรื่องนี้นอกจากความน่าติดตามของการสืบหาความจริงของคดีฆาตกรรมแล้ว ยังสะท้อนถึง lgbtq ในสังคมญี่ปุ่นในช่วงเวลาที่ฮิงาชิโนะ เคโงะเขียนเรื่องนี้(2001) ซึ่งก็มองแล้วอาจจะไม่ต่างจากบางสังคมในเวลานี้ รวมไปถึงยังเน้นย้ำถึงความพยายามความเข้าอกเข้าใจความหลากหลายของเพศหรือแม้แต่ของแต่ละคนเพื่อให้ทุกคนได้มีความสุขไม่ต้องทนทุกข์ในสิ่งที่ตัวเองเป็นอันจนกลายมาเป็นรักข้างเดียวของชื่อเรื่องนี้",5,0 likes,17
review_3204337887,Khánh Nguyễn,"Jul 02, 2020","The first time i read about homesexual in novel like this. Recently I read BL which gives me a viewpoint about gender, gay or les but it just stops in manga or fanfic and i still have intention to learn more about this matter.
This is new theme of Keigo sensei wrote but i was surprised that Sensei already wrote it in 2000. I just think this novel is new-published.
This novel tells story about people whose person inside and outside are different. It rose a question what defines man or woman by their nature or via biological characteristics?
There is no absolute truth or answer about this question. There are people who sometimes acts as a woman while he is a man outside and vice versa. I see myself in this case sometimes, like i’m a girl and truly want to be a girl until now but sometimes I try to be gentlemen like a men, make some flirtings or try to be strong outside and inside. It never deep down think about it, maybe the environment, family situation which affect me to be me now.
The novel said that there is no clear definition about man or woman, it’s like 2 direction line, it will be changed alternatively times by times from man to woman via situation. It somehow can make clear my actions.
The plot twist of this novel didn’t make me feel touched in its ending. Because people in novel choose what they wanted to do and tried their best to protect what they treasured and I think that’s enough. In short the story itself didn’t satisfy me.",3,0 likes,17

Sách của bác này thì mình auto đọc không cần cân nhắc 🤩🤩🤩 cho dù là trinh thám hay tâm lý, cho dù xưa hay nay.

Ví dụ như cuốn này được viết cách đây 20 năm, cái thời mà vấn đề giới tính thứ 3 bị kỳ thị, đặc biệt với 1 nước Nhật định kiến. Những người mang giới tính thứ 3 luôn mong muốn được sống đúng với bản chất thật sự của họ, và họ tìm mọi cách để đạt được điều đó. Tuy nhiên, nói đi cũng phải nói lại, trai hay gái, nam hay nữ chỉ là khái niệm tương đối thôi, trong mỗi con người đều có 2 phần, phần nào nhiều hơn sẽ lấn át phần còn lại, phần còn lại ấy vẫn ko mất hoàn toàn mà thỉnh thoảng vẫn sẽ thể hiện.

Về nội dung, mọi người xem phía trên nha, mình ko nói thêm nhiều vì sẽ spoil truyện mất. Cá nhân mình thấy một số đoạn tác giả kéo lê kéo lết đọc hơi mệt, nhân vật thì cứ dùng dằng không có dứt khoát vấn đề, và như thường lệ, mọi người sống kiểu chịu đựng nhau, nghe nó ngột ngạt bức bối lắm.

Về giải pháp để được sống đúng bản chất, tác giả quả thực rất tài tình, hợp lý không chê vào đâu được. Đương nhiên hiện tại người ta đã cởi mở hơn, pháp luật cũng đã có quy định về vấn đề chuyển giới, nhưng thời đó, giải pháp này khá ổn.",4,0 likes,17

This is the manga that you should read! This is about a guy who's been shot and been in vegetative state. The doctor then decides to do a brain transplant. Since then, Junichi can feel himself slowly change into someone else.

This manga was so intense from the start. The gloomy atmosphere, the creepy artstyle matched with the certain scenes. I love the idea and the concept. We explore the idea of the brain (how it could change according to the circumstances). There are various characters that are suspicious (cause most of them have their own motives instead of helping Junichi)

It is also hard to watch Junichi change into someone else (how he was so gentle and kind at the start but now he suddenly becomes violent). Very interesting. Can't wait to see what happens next.

Highly recommend!!!",4,2 likes,18

review_4100448644,Thuỷ Sún,"Jul 07, 2021","Lấy đề tài về vận động viên thể thao, ""Hung khí hoàn mỹ"" đối với mình không thật sự xuất sắc như mong đợi nhưng vẫn đủ hấp dẫn để tiếp tục đón đọc những tác phẩm khác của bác Keigo. Nếu được phép liên tưởng một tý thì cuốn sách này làm mình nhớ tới ""Trái tim của Brutus"", lấy bối cảnh hiện đại, những sự kiện chồng lấp để tạo nên những bất ngờ cần thiết nhưng vẫn đề cao tính nhân văn.

Bốn vận động viên thể thao sáng giá cùng có chung một bí mật đáng chôn vùi: Takuma, Junya, Yusuke và Shoko đã mạo hiểm đột nhập vào nhà của người đàn ông đang nắm đằng chuôi có thể đe dọa cuộc sống hạnh phúc họ dày công gây dựng bất cứ lúc nào. Chính những hành động đó đã mở ra một chuỗi những bi kịch, đây là cái giá họ phải trả hay cái kết của những âm mưu tàn bạo?

Cảm xúc của mình khi đọc cuốn sách này khá là ""ức chế"" vì sự chậm chạp và thiếu chuyên nghiệp của cảnh sát, những quyết định bồng bột thiếu suy nghĩ của các nhân vật trong truyện hay những tình tiết dù đoán được trước nhưng vẫn mong tác giả sẽ làm khác đi chẳng hạn. Nhưng dù vậy, đoạn kết lại khiến mình khá ấn tượng. Dù đã xác định đây là một cuốn trinh thám hành động nhưng đến trang cuối cùng, những gì còn sót lại của nhân vật báo thù lại là một chi tiết đáng giá khiến mình cực kỳ tâm đắc.

Nói tóm lại, ""Hung khí hoàn mỹ"" đem lại cho người đọc những giây phút gay cấn hồi hộp và có những chi tiết sáng giá để suy luận thêm về câu chuyện. Từ đó, bạn có thể thưởng thức tác phẩm một cách trọn vẹn hơn, cảm giác như đang ở trong một cuốn phim hành động và những mối đe dọa có thể ập tới bất cứ lúc nào - cái giá phải trả cho những hành động bất cẩn và sai lầm.",4,3 likes,19
review_4170187474,Nam,"Jun 12, 2022","Một trải nghiệm đọc sách trinh thám của Keigo đầy thú vị. Mình cảm tưởng như mỗi lần đọc 1 cuốn sách của Keigo là 1 trải nghiệm hoàn toàn mới. Nội dung tóm gọn thì cũng không cần phải kể lể nhiều. Mình chỉ nói đến cái thú vị của tác phẩm này đối với cá nhân mình
Thứ nhất là về chủ đề. Keigo luôn biết làm mới các tác phẩm của mình với 1 kho chủ đề phong phú và đa dạng. Hung khí hoàn mỹ cũng không ngoại lệ. Chủ đề chất cấm ""doping"" sử dụng trong thể thao là một chủ đề khá hấp dẫn và mới lạ đối với người đọc đã được Keigo lồng ghép với cốt truyện trinh thám vô cùng khéo léo
Thứ hai là về nhịp độ mạch truyện. Mình đọc nhiều sách của Keigo nhưng hiếm cuốn nào nhịp điệu của truyện nhanh dồn dập, đầy hồi hộp như Hung khí hoàn mỹ. Cảm giác như đang xem 1 bộ phim hành động với những tình tiết giật gân, bất ngờ liên tục đến nghẹt thở luôn ấy.
Plot twist thì cũng không có gì bất ngờ nhiều. Giống như dặm 1 chút gia vị ở cuối truyện tạo điểm nhấn thôi. Chi tiết cuối cùng nhân văn quá. Mình đọc cứ đợi mãi để xem con nhện Tarantula kia có còn một chút tính người nào không nhưng may quá Keigo vẫn để nhân vật của mình sót lại những mảnh rơi rớt của tính người, tình người.
Không hẳn là một cuốn sách xuất sắc nhưng đủ hay để níu chân người đọc tới những dòng cuối cùng.",4,,19

Vì sao bốn kẻ đó lại đột nhập vào biệt thự của Sendo, họ tìm thứ tài liệu gì để rồi vì giấu nhẹm một quá khứ nào đó, họ thiêu rụi cả căn nhà. Nhưng bốn người Anjo Takuma, Niya Junya, Hiura Yusuke, Sakura Shoko không ngờ rằng cái “nhà kho” của căn biệt thự nằm ngoài phạm vi đám cháy đang chứa trong đó một cơn ác mộng mà sớm thôi sẽ tìm đến họ để báo thù. Một cơ thể hoàn hảo với khối cơ bắp cuồn cuộn, di chuyển nhanh nhẹn, thể lực không tưởng, một con nhện Tarantula đã bật chế độ săn mồi.

Những bí mật dần được hé mở. Cùng với đó là những nước đi truy sát kịch tính đến từ vị trí kẻ đi săn. Sự kịch tính không chỉ nằm ở những màn hạ sát trực diện mà còn nằm trong từng đường đi nước bước của cả hai phe. Con mồi cũng là kẻ đi săn. Cảnh sát trong “Hung khí hoàn mỹ” tỏ ra khá bất lực trong việc truy tìm hung thủ, nhưng cũng phải đánh giá cao khả năng điều tra suy luận của họ, đã đoán đúng được những gì đã diễn ra.

Mình có cảm giác cô gái được ví von như nhện Tarantula chính là ẩn dụ cho nỗi sợ hãi của những kẻ che giấu những bí mật đen tối. Họ sợ một ngày nào đó sự thật sẽ bị phơi bày, tất cả tiền tài danh vọng họ có được sẽ biến mất khi Tarantula gõ cửa. Thêm một vấn đề mà mình nghĩ bác Keigo muốn đề cập là sự kỳ vọng của bố mẹ đặt lên con cái. Họ xem con cái như một sự tiếp nối ước mơ mà thế hệ của họ đã không làm được. Đặt lên vai con trẻ mơ ước của bản thân. Phải chi mơ ước đó là của chính các em thơ. Phải chi…

Về diễn biến câu chuyện thì luôn có chỗ cho độc giả suy luận. Mình đã nhận ra có chỗ lấn cấn ở hành động của một người trong số bốn người đã nhắc ở trên, vì nếu người đó hành động như vậy thì thật khác lẽ thường. Từ đó mình đoán được phần nào diễn biến tiếp theo. Chỉ là mình không nghĩ tất cả đều được kẻ đó suy tính từ đầu. Cũng có một chi tiết nhỏ mình thấy bất hợp lý ở trang 323, không biết có phải là mình bỏ sót ở đâu không. Nếu mọi người cũng nhận ra thì cho mình biết với nha.",4,,19

เปิดบทก็มีนักกีฬา 4 คน เข้าไปในบ้านเพื่อทำลายหลักฐานการใช้ยาชูกำลังเพื่อให้ได้รับชัยชนะ ในการแข่งกีฬา แล้วผู้หญิงคนหนึ่งในกลุ่มดันพลั้งฆ่าคนที่ผลิตยาชูกำลังให้ ทำให้ทุกคนร่วมใจกันเผาบ้าน เพื่อทำลายหลักฐานให้สิ้นซาก

พอตำรวจเข้ามาทำการตรวจสอบ ก็พบว่า ผู้ตาย คนที่ผลิตยาชูกำลังเนี้ย แอบปั้นผู้หญิงคนหนึ่งเพื่อมาเป็นอาวุธที่ใช้ตามสังหารคน หลัก ๆ ก็ตามฆ่านักกีฬา 4 คนนี้แหละ เราอ่านถึงตรงนี้เราจะพบ ว่าแม่นางคนนี้ทำร้าย หรือฆ่าคนเพื่อบรรลุเป้าหมายจริง ๆ แถมนางยังมีอดีตที่เจ็บปวด มาพร้อมกับความทรมานที่ดำมืด ที่ทำให้ตัวเองแข็งแกร่ง น้ำตาคลอเลยนะ เอาจริง ๆ

อาวุธแสนสวยก็ตามไล่ฆ่า ไปทีล่ะคน ตามสไตล์แนวการฆาตกรรมต่อเนื่องนี้แหละ จนมาถึงท้ายบท นี้แหละ ที่ทำให้เราแทบร้องกรี๊ด เพราะเคโงะ ทำให้ผู้อ่านเข้าใจมาตลอดเกือบจะจบเล่มว่า นางคนนี้แหละคือ คนร้าย แต่แท้ความจริงแล้ว คนที่ร้ายกว่าก็คือ คนร้ายตัวจริง ที่คอยวางแผนอยู่เบื้องหลัง และฆ่าพวกเดียวกัน 55555

Giá mà 4 người ấy không để quá khứ đè nặng lên mình, chấp nhận trả giá cho những sai lầm năm xưa, thì đã không đến mức người thì mất mạng, kẻ lại liên tiếp gây ra tội lỗi.

Nhân vật cô gái ""nhện độc"" thật sự đáng thương. Dù trong quá trình trả thù cho Sendo cô ấy liên tục gây ra cái chết cho những người không liên quan, nhưng cũng thật khó để ghét được cô.

Ngay từ đầu thì hung thủ và động cơ đã được làm rõ rồi nên truyện không khiến người đọc suy đoán gì đâu, thay vào đó là cảm giác hồi hộp vì tên sát nhân đang tìm đến từng người một để trả thù (khá giống phim hành động).
Không phải là một tác phẩm quá sâu sắc của Keigo tuy nhiên cũng rất thú vị và cho mình một chút hiểu biết về giới thể thao. Tác phẩm này nên được 3,5 ⭐️ nhưng tiếc là Goodreads chỉ rate được số chẵn thui 😅",3,1 like,19

review_4087182124,À ngơ lơ mơ,"Jul 01, 2021","Đúng như mình dự đoán, ""Hung khí hoàn mỹ"" được tác giả viết trong thời kì đầu của sự nghiệp nên đây không phải là cuốn sách thực sự xuất sắc của ông. Tuy nhiên, nó đã chứng minh được tài năng cũng như khuynh hướng tạo cho mỗi nhân vật một câu chuyện ẩn đằng sau mỗi vụ án. Để qua đó, người đọc có cái nhìn đa chiều hơn về các vấn đề xã hội và tác động của nó tới tâm lý con người.

Có thể nói đây là một tác phẩm trinh thám xen lẫn yếu tố hình sự, hành động thì đúng hơn là trinh thám cổ điển. Diễn biến truyện khá nhanh, tập trung theo hành trình của nhân vật, phía cảnh sát khá ""bù nhìn"" khi chỉ có thể theo sau hung thủ và đưa ra một số suy luận tương đối dễ dàng. Tác giả vẫn thành công khi tạo ra được nhịp điệu hồi hộp, gay cấn, tạo được cảm giác giống như đang theo dõi một bộ phim hành động và cũng không quên cài cắm một vài chi tiết về yếu tố nhân sinh quan- một yếu tố mà sau này theo mình đã trở thành điểm đặc biệt trong các tác phẩm khác của tác giả. Người đọc quen thuộc của Higashino Keigo sau cuốn này sẽ lại có thêm một vài cái tên của những người phụ nữ xinh đẹp nguy hiểm để thêm vào bộ sưu tập của mình.

Tóm lại, mình nghĩ cuốn này phù hợp với những ai mới bắt đầu đọc truyện trinh thám, muốn thử nghiệm cảm giác suy luận đơn giản và dành cho fan của Keigo sensei.

review_4342726226,Đặng Nhật Vũ,"Nov 17, 2021","** spoiler alert ** *Tóm tắt nội dung:
Tiểu thuyết mở ra bằng vụ đột nhập của 4 nhân vật từng là vận động viên Olympic đại diện cho Nhật Bản. Mục đích của họ là lấy đi tài liệu về doping mà bác sĩ Sendo từng cho họ sử dụng. Vụ đột nhập bị phát hiện bởi bác sĩ Sendo và án mạng xảy ra.
4 VĐV không biết rằng ngôi nhà bên cạnh còn có một người đặc biệt do bác sĩ Sendo tạo ra, như là một “cỗ máy” thể thao thực sự. Cô gái không có tên, chỉ được tác giả gọi là “Cô gái” và đặt biệt danh là “Nhện Tarantula”. Quyển này thuộc thể loại hành động nhiều hơn là trinh thám. Nhiều nhân vật phải bỏ mạng trong cuộc săn mồi của nhện Tarantula.
*Điểm mình thích:
- Tác phẩm lồng vào những sự thật kinh hoàng về doping, về cách mà VĐV qua mặt những thử nghiệm doping. Những VĐV cố bảo vệ những hào quang đạt được không phải bằng sức lực của mình đã phải trả giá đắt. Và cả ông bác sĩ Sendo, vì mục đích mà bất chấp mọi thủ đoạn cũng phận quả táo nhãn lồng.
- Cách viết lôi cuốn, tình tiết dồn dập liên tục, gần như không có chi tiết thừa. Mọi hành động, mọi cuộc chiến đấu đều được diễn tả một cách chân thật.
- Một ít plot twist mini cuối tác phẩm cũng tạm ổn.
*Điểm mình chưa thích:
- Nhiều tình tiết khá là hư cấu, các nhân vật biết mình bị truy đuổi nhưng không báo cảnh sát mà cứ tìm cách trốn chạy. Có thể do người Nhật quý trọng danh dự còn hơn cả tính mạng bản thân. Cảnh sát thì quá là vô dụng, cho dù đặt trong hoàn cảnh năm 1992 đi nữa thì sự lề mề trong một án mạng liên hoàn, hung thủ lại là một cô gái cao 1m9 hoàn toàn nổi bật, toàn đi đến những địa điểm đông người như ga tàu, tiệm Mac Donald’s, cửa hàng tiện lợi,… mà vẫn không bắt được.
- Động cơ của hung thủ không đủ mạnh để gây ra một vụ thảm sát hàng loạt, cũng là một điểm vô lý lớn trong truyện.",3,0 likes,19
review_4401750227,uyen,"Dec 22, 2021","Với bối cảnh giới thể thao chuyên nghiệp và những vấn nạn xung quanh việc sử dụng doping, steroid hay Adderall để tăng hiệu suất thi đấu, ""Hung khí hoàn mỹ"" khiến mình liên tưởng đến bộ phim tài liệu đã đạt giải Oscar là Icarus - một bộ phim xoay quanh lùm xùm doping của liên đoàn thể thao Nga trên đấu trường thể thao thế giới, trong đó có cả Olympic. Vì vậy mình cũng hơi bất ngờ khi biết quyển sách này đã được Keigo Higashino viết và xuất bản từ năm 1992, rất lâu trước khi doping và steroid trở thành một vấn đề nóng. Và ở một phương diện nào đó, việc lựa chọn được một chủ đề mới mẻ như vậy là thành công lớn nhất của quyển sách này.

Với cá nhân mình thì ""Hung khí hoàn mỹ"" nhàm từ diễn biến, tuyến nhân vật cho đến cách viết của tác giả. Diễn biến tình tiết thì quá dễ đoán (mà thật ra cũng chẳng có nút thắt nào ở đây), nhân vật được xây dựng mờ nhạt, vô hồn và ngòi bút thì bình bình, thiếu đột phá. Dù cũng có những màn rượt đuổi, mèo vờn chuột và cả những cú lật mặt phút cuối thì mình vẫn ngáp ngắn ngáp dài mãi mới đọc hết 300 trang sách.

Cái kết khiến mình có chút hụt hẫng, vẫn biết sẽ là 1 cái kết mở nhưng mình vẫn nghĩ nó sẽ dài hơn đi sâu hơn 1 chút, mình cần thêm những thông tin để giải đáp thắc mắc nhưng mà truyện lại kết thúc rồi 🥹
Một cuốn sách như thước phim trả thù rượt đuổi kịch tính vậy, càng về sau cuộc đối đầu càng thêm lôi cuốn và hấp dẫn, mạch truyện cũng nhanh hơn và bánh cuốn hơn 🫶 Tuy nhiên vẫn chưa phải là một cuốn sách xuất sắc vì nó vẫn dễ dàng lờ mờ đoán được các tình tiết, cũng như hình ảnh của phần kết truyện.

Để che dấu cái bí mật có thể ảnh hưởng đến tương lai của họ, 4 vận động viên này đã lập ra 1 kế hoạch tưởng chừng rất hoàn hảo để có thể trộm được tất cả những tài liệu liên quan đến việc họ sử dụng loại dopping đặc biệt này. Nhưng họ không thể ngờ rằng, chính họ khi thực hiện kế hoạch này lại bị cuốn vào 1 cuộc truy đuổi vô cùng tàn khốc mà cái chết là cái đã được báo trước cho họ. Đọc cuons này xong mình thấy được ngay tác giả muốn đề cao lên cái tinh thần thể thao đỉnh cao chân chính, phải dùng chính thực lực của bản thân để vượt qua mọi thử thách. Thành tích suy cho cùng là gì khi thực ra nó lại chỉ là 1 màn lửa đảo, bất chấp mọi thứ để sử dụng những gian lân. Ở cuối chuyện cũng có 1 khoảng lặng rất hay về tình mẫu tử nữa mà mình không muốn spoil.

Điểm cộng to nhất là ngay cả trong một truyện thuần hành động truy đuổi giết chóc như Hung Khí Hoàn Mỹ, ở những dòng cuối cùng tác giả vẫn có cách kết khiến lòng mình nhói lên khe khẽ rồi nhẹ lan thành nỗi buồn man mác.

Mạch truyện nhanh, đọc ko chán, dù cách viết thiếu tính văn, kiểu có nhiều đoạn câu cứ cụt cụt sao đó, đọc ko đc mềm mại cho lắm.
Chi tiết kết thúc khá là “chạm” - cũng chính là điểm mình thích trong các tác phẩm của Higashino, luôn có yếu tố nhân văn sâu sắc.
Dù gì thì nguyên nhân để “cô gái” đi báo thù thấy cũng ko thuyết phục lắm, nếu nhìn vào cách tay bác sĩ kia đối xử với cô. Mình đã mong sẽ có sự giải thích vì sao hắn gặp đc cô, vì sao cô đồng ý theo hắn, biến đổi mình và sống cuộc sống như vậy. Nhưng rốt cuộc lại không hề có nên thành ra cốt truyện kém chặt chẽ.

Mấy bài đồng dao này toàn là kinh dị, hoặc có lịch sử hình thành man rợ ko à, gớm nhất là cái bài London Bridge á
Truyện hay nhờ yếu tố đồng dao :v còn cái trope án mạng trong phòng kín mình ko care lắm vì nó quá bình thường rùi ## nói chung là lại 1 quyển nữa giống Conan :v
Dù sao mình vẫn thích hơn quyển Kairotei. À còn nữa ông thanh tra trong này y chang ông Hercule Poirot :v
Mà công nhận mấy quyển thập niên 80 của Keigo có gì đó non thật á, thì cũng hay (kiểu trinh thám) nhưng mình đang cần những quyển bá đạo hơn, cỡ level của Nghi can X hoặc Ác ý cơ 😶",3,7 likes,23

Ái chà, lâu lắm mới gặp lại bác Keigo nên cho bác lên sóng liền.

Vụ án mạng ở nhà khách núi Hakuba theo chân Naoko – em gái của Koichi, mùa đông năm trước anh đã tự sát tại nhà khách Hakuba và để lại một tấm bưu thiết với câu hỏi khó hiểu: “Mẹ Maria đã về nhà khi nào?"" Vốn đã bán tín bán nghi cái chết của anh trai mình, Naoko cùng người bạn học Makoto đến thăm nhà khách “Mẹ Ngỗng” nằm trên núi Hakuba với mong muốn làm rõ uẩn khúc đằng sau cái chết của anh trai. Kỳ lạ thay, mùa đông năm nay nhà khách “Mẹ Ngỗng” lại tiếp tục mở cửa đón những vị khách quen thuộc hệt một năm trước đó. Liệu có phải tồn tại một bí mật hay một quá khứ đen tối nào bị giấu kín sau cái mác “nhà khách Mẹ Ngỗng” hay không ta?

Khá dễ dàng để nhận thấy Vụ án mạng ở nhà khách núi Hakuba là một trong những tác phẩm “thời kì đầu” được sáng tác trong khoảng thập niên 80 của Higashino Keigo, bởi quả thật diễn biến và tình tiết vụ án trong cuốn sách này khá đơn giản (so với X và Bạch dạ hành được biết đến với tình tiết lắt léo và căng cực hơn cả). Vụ án mạng ở nhà khách Hakuba là án mạng trong phòng kín, hao hao mấy vụ thường xuyên xảy ra trong manga Conan đã quen thuộc với độc giả. Tuy nhiên, vụ án ở Hakuba cũng có sức hấp dẫn của riêng mình, đặc biệt khi tác giả Higashino Keigo đã khéo léo mượn bài đồng dao Mẹ Ngỗng xuyên suốt câu chuyện nhằm dẫn dắt độc giả (hay trong tác phẩm là nhân vật chính) giải vụ án này. Có thể nói rằng, đồng dao Mẹ Ngỗng chính là chiếc chìa khóa để mở cánh cửa đóng kín, hé lộ chân tướng thực sự của hung thủ.

Nhưng của đáng tội, chắc do đã lỡ sa chân vào “bom tấn” Nghi can X, Bạch dạ hành, Bí mật của Naoko và những tác phẩm sau đó của Keigo trước nên Vụ án mạng ở nhà khách núi Hakuba tớ chỉ ấn tượng duy nhất với bìa sách, còn lại thì không ấn tượng lắm. Và cảm nhận cá nhân thì hai em nữ chính trong sách khá liều khi chỉ mới 18-19 tuổi mà một mình xông pha điều tra án mạng như thế trong khi bản thân chưa trang bị đủ “kiến thức” cần thiết, giống như mấy nam thanh nữ tú trong phim ma ấy, cứ ngửi thấy mùi nguy hiểm là lao đầu vô không cần biết trời cao đất hỡi gì. Đặc biệt là Naoko mang mác nhân vật trung tâm của câu chuyện mà có phần lép vế hơn so với cô bạn Makoto về khả năng suy luận. Hơi buồn cười, nhưng mạch truyện chính tức vụ án mạng tại nhà khách Hakuba đối với riêng tớ thì không hấp dẫn bằng tuyến truyện phụ, liên quan đến nhân vật Kojima cũng như ông chủ và người đầu bếp của nhà khách Hakuba, thậm chí câu chuyện liên quan đến bà chủ cũ của nhà khách “Mẹ Ngỗng” còn níu kéo tớ hơn là vụ án mạng xuyên suốt cuốn sách.

Rút ra thêm một điều nữa, đó là trong những cuốn tớ đã đọc của Keigo thì chị em phụ nữ đáng sợ thiệt đó lol.

Nhìn chung, Vụ án mạng ở nhà khách núi Hakuba có lẽ thích hợp hơn cho những fan cứng của bác Keigo, hoặc là những bạn nào mới “chập chững” bước đầu tiên khám phá hành trình “Keigo học” thì có thể mở màn bằng cuốn này. Bìa đẹp, dịch ổn, nhưng hơi tiếc là nội dung chưa “nặng đô” lắm, các bạn tham khảo nha.",3,15 likes,23

review_3866711662,Thuỷ Sún,"Mar 01, 2021","Mỗi người phụ nữ trên trang văn của Keigo tiên sinh nói chung, trên trang viết Vụ án mạng ở nhà khách Hakuba nói riêng đều là những tạo tác đầy cá tính. Không cam chịu số phận, cũng chẳng cam chịu sự sắp đặt của người khác; thông minh và đa đoan với chấp niệm cá nhân tới tận cùng, kể cả khi không còn trên cuộc đời.

Đồng dao Mẹ Ngỗng khi đặt trong tiểu thuyết Vụ án mạng ở nhà khách núi Hakuba không đơn thuần chỉ mang giá trị biểu tượng như thế. Mà sâu hơn, bài đồng dao ấy còn chất chứa nỗi niềm, tình yêu thương cha mẹ gửi tới những đứa con khi biết đôi bên sẽ đôi bờ sinh tử.

Đó là nỗi lòng của người cha, muốn bù đắp cuộc sống cho người con phải chịu kiếp ngoài giá thú. Đó là nỗi lòng của người mẹ, một lòng thương yêu gia đình, vì con và sẵn sàng làm tất cả mọi thứ cho đứa con, kể cả khi đứa trẻ đã không còn trên cõi đời.

review_4366907061,Nguyet Minh,"Dec 02, 2021","Cuốn truyện xuất bản năm 1986 khi Keigo gần tròn 30 thế nhưng vẫn còn thiếu sự nhuần nhuyễn của một tiểu thuyết gia trinh thám thực thụ. Cách đặt vấn đề và dựng bối cảnh rất tốt nhưng sự khai thác địa điểm, thời tiết và cách sinh hoạt tiêu biểu của những người địa phương lẫn khách phương xa còn thiếu. Điều đó gây nên những hạn chế khi diễn giải tâm lý nhân vật. Hakuba vốn dĩ là vùng trượt tuyết nổi tiếng nhất nhì Nhật Bản, giá như địa hình hiểm trở ở đây với sự lạnh lẽo giá buốt được khai thác nhiều hơn nữa và những án mạng thêm phần bí ẩn hơn nữa, có lẽ sẽ cuốn hút độc giả hơn.

Mô típ của truyện khá giống với cuốn trinh thám khác của Keigo là cuốn “Án mạng mười một chữ”. Chính người thân hoặc người bạn của nạn nhân tự trở thành thám tử để điều tra vụ án, cảnh sát chỉ có vai trò cô đọng lại và kết luận. Ở đây, Naoko và người bạn Makoto đã làm tốt vai trò tự quyết của mình. Mặc dù những lập luận còn khá lủng củng và lan man nhưng đoạn cuối cũng được giải quyết khá tốt. Sự độc đáo trong vụ án này có lẽ là việc giải ám hiệu của những bài đồng dao. Qua đó, sự thật về những vụ án liên quan trước đó cũng được mở ra, cho người chết được yên nghỉ và người sống bớt tò mò dằn vặt.

Nói chung, vụ án đơn giản quá, tình tiết nổi trội hầu như không có, cách lập luận về việc đóng mở cửa của căn phòng khá giống Agatha Christie đã từng làm. Chính vì thế cảm giác đọc thiếu sự hồi hộp và cuốn hút. Vẫn hơi tiếc vì tựa truyện thì rất hay nhưng nội dung chưa lột tả được như mong muốn.",3,,23

เรื่องนี้เป็นการไขคดีในห้องปิดตายและไขปริศนารหัสลับที่แฝงมาในเพลงกล่อมเด็ก mothergoose ซึ่งพอเราไม่รู้จักเพลงกล่อมเด็กพวกนี้ก็ทำให้อ่านไม่ค่อยสนุกแฮะ

Một vụ án mạng trong phòng kín thật là li kì :D Tác giả vẫn sử dụng lối viết thật cuốn hút như mọi khi, khiến mình cảm thấy thật khó để mà dừng đọc.

Những nhân vật phụ nữ trong cuốn sách này đặc biệt được đề cao. Cô gái mạnh mẽ vượt qua sự đau buồn sau cái chết nhiều ẩn ức của anh trai. Cô gái kiên cường tìm ra tất cả sự thật. Cô gái táo tợn dám xuống tay giết người (ôi cái này là phẩm chất tốt, nhưng bị sử dụng cho một hành vi thật tệ!).

Sau màn đêm là ánh bình minh rực đỏ. Câu chuyện khép lại với sad ending cho gần như tất cả các nhân vật (trừ Makoto và Kamijo). Nhưng rồi ai nấy cũng sẽ bình tâm và tìm được hạnh phúc mới, mình tin vậy.

Trước ngày tự sát thì anh trai có gửi cho Naoko một bức bưu thiếp với câu hỏi nhờ em mình tìm xem “Maria đã về nhà khi nào”. Đây là một cuốn của bác Higashino Keigo thời đầu mới chuyển mình sang trinh thám, với motip kinh điển là án mạng phòng kín, khu vực biệt lập và giải mật mã.

Nếu đây là cuốn đầu tiên mình đọc của Keigo thì sẽ đánh giá cao hơn chút, nhưng do đọc hơi nhiều và so sánh với những cuốn khác, cộng với giá tiền quá mắc (138k giá bìa) trong khi truyện cũ (xuất bản năm 1986) và ngắn (mỏng, chữ to) thì tạm đánh giá cho 3/5 sao :)).

แขกที่เลือกมาพัก มาเพราะที่นี่ไม่มีสิ่งอำนวยความสะดวกใดๆ เลย ทั้งไม่มีที่ท่องเที่ยวอื่นๆ ด้วย ทำได้เพียงเล่นสกีและชมทัศนียภาพของขุนเขาเท่านั้น

ตัวเอกของเล่มนี้มี 2 คน คือ นาโอโกะ กับ มาโคโตะ

นาโอโกะไม่เชื่อว่าพี่ชายตนเองจะไปฆ่าตัวตาย ณ บ้านพักบนภูเขาแบบนั้น เธอรู้แค่ว่าพี่ชายกำลังออกเดินทางท่องเที่ยว และพี่ก็ไม่มีสาเหตุอะไรให้ต้องจบชีวิตตัวเอง

เธอรอให้คดีผ่านไปจนครบปี แล้วจึงออกเดินทางไปเยือนบ้านพักแห่งนั้น นาโอโกะเป็นเพียงนักศึกษาธรรมดา เธอขอให้มาโคโตะไปเป็นเพื่อนเธอด้วย (ไม่เคยอ่านเจอตัวละครแบบมาโคโตะจากเรื่องอื่นของคุณเคโงะมาก่อน น่ารักดีค่ะ)

ถ้าใครชอบอ่านงานไขรหัสปริศนาคงชอบเล่มนี้ ตอนแรกเราก็นึกว่าเป็นงานฆาตกรรมในห้องปิดตายที่บ้านตากอากาศหรูๆ อีกแล้ว (นึกว่าจะเหมือนเรื่องหน้ากากมนุษย์ สนพ.เนชั่น) แต่ไม่ใช่เลยค่ะ

เล่มฮากูบะฯ ไม่ได้ให้น้ำหนักคนตายมากเท่าการไขรหัส และด้วยเหตุนี้ เราเลยได้ทั้งแผนผังบ้านพักและเนื้อเพลงกล่อมเด็กของมาเธอร์กูสทุกเพลง (แกะรอยยากอยู่ดีค่ะ 555) คุณเคโงะแกเล่นเรื่องไขรหัสจนถึงหน้าสุดท้ายเลยจริงๆ

เรื่องนี้ ตัวละครเยอะมาก ตามสไตล์คดีคนตายในบ้านพักตากอากาศ สนพ.ใจดีมากที่ให้รายชื่อตัวละคร พร้อมคำอธิบายประกอบด้วยว่าใครเป็นใคร เพราะจำไม่ไหวจริงๆ ค่ะ

Trước khi đọc mình đã xem review của mọi người cẩn thận, mà xét ra thì theo những gì mình đọc được đây không phải là tác phẩm được đánh giá cao bằng những quyển bự hơn về sau này. Nhưng mình vẫn quyết định sẽ chọn quyển này vì mình thích mấy cái giải mật mã và ám hiệu, lại còn ẩn trong mấy bài đồng dao nước Anh nữa.

Với một đứa không hay đọc trinh thám và đầu óc không nhạy bén lắm như mình, mình chỉ nhận xét một cách chủ quan là nó khá hút mình. Có một chút gì đó ma mị, căng thẳng trong một không gian được dựng lên rất là ""crime scene"". Các nhân vật được xây dựng khá đậm nét và câu chuyện về những bài đồng dao nước Anh thì rất thú vị.

Maybe I just don't like school settings all that much? This book is set in some kind of resort where each room has a different eerie nursery rhyme theme and the rooms are somehow connected to a secret kept by the resort owner? Oh, and they might be related to someone who committed suicide at this very resort YEARS ago. I like the whole idea about the themed rooms and the whole riddle-solving/clue-finding/treasure-hunting thing about the nursery rhymes.

หนังสือที่พลิกหลายตลบเหลือเกิน อะไรจะพลิกไปพลิกมาขนาดนี้ และเพราะความสัมพันธ์ที่ซับซ้อนไปมา จึงต้องทำให้ทุกคนต้องกลับมาเพื่อรวมตัวกันที่นี้อีกครั้ง

เมื่อเรื่องราวที่ตำรวจตัดสินว่า พี่ชายตัวเองฆ่าตัวตาย แต่ทำไมนะ น้องสาวกลับรู้สึกถึงความผิดแปลกอย่างบอกไม่ถูก ดังนั้น เธอกับเพื่อนจึงต้องมารับบทนักสืบจำเป็น

“รหัสลับที่ซ่อนอยู่ภายในความจริง
ที่ซ่อนเร้นจนน่ากลัว”

บ้านพักมาร์เธอร์กูส หรือแม่ห่าน ที่เธอกับเพื่อนต้องมาค้นหาความจริง ว่า มีอะไรซ่อนเร้นอยู่ในนี้ ในขณะที่เรื่องราวของทั้งสองกำลังค้นหารหัสอยู่นั้น

“ความจริงที่ซ่อนเร้นก็ปรากฎ
ความลับที่ไม่อยากให้ใครรับรู้ก็ถูกเปิดเผย”

เปรียบดั่ง
“ชีวิตของคนเราที่เห็นอยู่นี้
หารู้ดีมีพอใจนั้นมีไหม
เมื่อพบเจออัญมณีกองมากมาย
อยากได้เป็นของตัวเองมาครอง”

นาโอโกะและมาโคโตะเดินทางมาที่บ้านมาเธอร์กูส เพื่อตามหาความจริงถึงการตายของพี่ชายตัวเอง 'โคอิจิ' ว่า เหตุใด พี่ชายถึงฆ่าตัวตาย เพราะว่า นาโอโกะได้รับโปสการ์ดจากพี่ชายหลังตายไปว่า “พระแม่มารีย์ กลับบ้านเมื่อไหร่” และเมื่อทั้งสองมาถึงก็กลับพบว่า บ้านหลังนี้มีคาถาลับและรหัสลับ เพื่อจะไปถึงเรื่องๆหนึ่ง ซึ่งรหัสลับนี้จะถูกซ่อนในบทเพลงของแต่ละบทที่อยู่ในห้องแต่ละห้องของบ้านนี้

ในขณะที่ทำการสืบอยู่ หลายๆคนก็ดูน่าแปลกไปหมด แต่ยิ่งสืบก็ยิ่งค้นพบหลายสิ่งที่ว่า ""โคอิจิ พี่ชายนาโอโกะไม่ได้ฆ่าตัวตายแน่ เพราะกำลังไขรหัสลับบางอย่างอยู่"" แล้วพอยิ่งสืบไปก็กลับกลายเป็นว่า การตายของโคอิจิ ไปเกี่ยวข้องกับคดีเมื่อสองปีก่อนเข้า และใครล่ะที่น่ากลัวที่สุด ความลับที่อยู่ในรหัสนี้ สำคัญอย่างไร จนกระทั่งวันหนึ่ง วันที่ไม่น่ามีอะไร โอกิ ผู้พักคนหนึ่งในบ้านหลังนี้ได้กลายเป็นศพ และเพราะความตายของโอกินี่เองที่นำไปสู่ความจริงที่ใกล้จะเปิดเผย

เมื่อตำรวจที่ต้องมาตรวจสอบคดีของโอกิได้ตัดสินใจพักที่บ้านหลังนี้ และเริ่มพบกับความแปลกของหลายๆคน จึงสามารถที่จะจับได้ว่า ใครเป็นคนร้าย และทั้งนาโอโกะและมาโคโตะสามารถช่วยตำรวจไขคดี โดยอาศัยรหัสลับเหล่านี้ว่า ห้องปิดตายนั้นทำได้อย่างไร และทั้งหมดพบว่า เรื่องจริงคืออะไร

1.) ภรรยาของคาวาซากิจ้างให้คามิโจมาตามหารหัสที่คาวาซากิขนอัญมณีปลอมไปให้ลูกของเมียน้อย ซึ่งคือ ทากาเซะ
2.) คามิโจจ้างโคอิจิมาช่วยไขรหัสลับ แต่โคอิจิดันมาถูกฆ่าตายด้วยเอนามิและคูรูมิ ซึ่งเอนามิฆ่าโอกิด้วย
3.) มาสเตอร์ต้องมาดูแลบ้านหลังนี้ เพราะถูกรหัสลับที่ต้องมาเฝ้าสุสานลูกชายของหญิงอังกฤษที่ตนรัก เนื่องจากมาสเตอร์เป็นคนปล่อยให้ลูกชายของหญิงคนนี้ตาย

บางคนปล่อยใจตัวเองให้ทำความชั่วจนถลำลึกขนาดนี้ได้อย่างไร ส่วนบางคนพยายามที่จะแก้ไขความผิดในสิ่งที่ตัวเองทำผิดมาก โดยจมอยู่กับความผิดที่ตัวเองสร้าง บางคนเป็นทาสรักและทาสโลภจนกล้าทำผิดทุกอย่าง ทำไม หลายคนถึงเป็นแบบนี้ได้

หลายครั้งที่เราอ่านหนังสือของอาจารย์เคโงะและเราพบว่า มันไม่สามารถหยุดอ่านได้ เพราะเนื้อหาของเรื่องทั้งตรึงเราไว้กับการอ่าน เนื้อหาที่เสียดสีสังคม เนื้อหาที่ตีแผ่ความจริงของมนุษย์ เนื้อหาที่สะท้อนปัญหาส่วนลึกของจิตใจมนุษย์ และเล่มนี้ก็เป็นอีกเรื่องหนึ่งเช่นกัน

“เมื่อเราเลี้ยงความโลภ ความโกรธ ความหลงเต็มใจหัวใจ ก็เท่ากับว่า
ได้หล่อเลี้ยงปีศาจร้ายในตัวเอง”

Đây là một quyển sách cũng khá oke cho những người mới đọc trinh thám ( tui nghĩ dẫy ) và nó cũng chỉ là thuần trinh thám tkui chứ không có bao gồm những vấn đề xã hội nên đọc xong thì chắc không bị nặng lòng đâu =)). Truyện kể về 2 người bạn là Naoko và Makoto ( thề lúc đầu đọc cứ bị lộn tên ấy=)) trong đó Naoko có 1 người anh trai mất tại 1 khu nghỉ dưỡng trên núi. Cảnh sát thì đều cho rằng anh trai cô đã tự sát nhưng Naoko đã không nghĩ như thế, cô đã nghỉ rằng anh trai mình bị sát hại nên cô đã cùng người bạn của mình đợi 1 năm sau để có thể quay trở lại khu nghỉ dưỡng đấy để tìm ra câu trả lời cho cái kết của anh trai. Và từ đấy họ khám phá ra những bí mật về khu nghỉ dưỡng và cả tin đồn ở đấy có kho báu nữa. Theo mình thấy thì mạch truyện cũng khá cuốn nhưng phần đầu sẽ hơi bị lan man một chút. Kiểu 2 nhân vật lúc đầu hơi bị dửng dưng quá í =)) nhma đến phần sau thì càng ngày càng cuốn hơn. Đối với một con ngu mấy mật mã hay ám hiệu như mình thì mình cũng hiểu được những ý nghĩa của mấy cái ám hiệu của mấy bài đồng dao cổ nhma cũng không đến mức oà lên ấy ( chắc tại mình hơi kén mấy cái đấy). Nhưng nếu bạn nào thích ám hiệu đồ thì mình nghĩ sẽ thích cuốn này ấy. Đến phần cuối thì mạch truyện nhanh hơn, cũng nhiều twist hơn. Đặc biệt là có 1 câu hỏi được xuất hiện ở đầu truyện “ Ai đã giết Cock Robin? -Là ta- chim sẻ nói” thì được tg kiểu để lại cho mn tự tìm hiểu ấy. Nếu thích bạn cũng có thể xem video giải thích của chị “ toàn là sách” thì mình thấy khá hay ấy.

NÓI CHUNG LÀ vì mình không quá mê trinh thám lắm vì đây vẫn là cuốn đầu ấy nhưng mình thấy cuốn này ổn nha. Hợp cho những bạn thích trinh thám thuần, thích kiểu giải mấy cái ám hiệu ấy.

review_4287700446,Quyen Minh Khuat,"Oct 14, 2021","Tổng quan mà nói thì truyện là tác phẩm có lẽ là ""Conan"" nhất của bác Keigo, lí do được cụ thể ở các phần mình thích và chưa thích lắm

Điểm mình thích ở sách:
- Một câu chuyện trinh thám rất dễ hình dung và theo dõi (so với Phía sau nghi can X hay Bí mật của Naoko,...), dù lượng nhân vật tương đối nhiều. Một phần vì mỗi nhân vật được thể hiện rõ qua 1 vài hành động/đặc tính cực kì đặc trưng. Một phần là do sự đặc trưng đó khiến mình liên tưởng đến một số nhân vật trong Conan, có thể đây là một vài traits của truyện trinh thám Nhật (?). Một phần là truyện được viết ở góc nhìn người thứ 3, nên khách quan, và bao quát
- Những câu chuyện về những bài đồng dao cổ của Anh thực sự được kể quá ấn tượng. Ai đọc có lẽ cũng hơi lạnh gáy khi đến mấy câu chuyện về London bridge
- Đoạn cuối gỡ dần các nút thắt, các bí mật được hé lộ đan chéo vào nhau rất ấn tượng. Mình đã nghĩ case đã closed, nhưng thật ra là chưa. Lần lữa lần lữa đến những trang cuối cùng.
- Những người phụ nữ trong truyện của bác Keigo quá là badass luôn. Những vị trí mấu chốt nhất, luôn là phụ nữ LOL

Điều mình chưa thích lắm:
- Phần đầu tạo nên context của case hơi đồ sộ quá. Nhưng cũng khó trách vì lượng nhân vật là quá nhiều. Cao trào đổ dồn vào 40% cuối
- Có lẽ vì truyện được viết rất lâu rồi, cộng với mình cũng xem đủ thể loại truyện và phim trinh thám hiện đại, nên mình hơi hụt hẫng với thủ thuật gây án. Khá cũ và kinh điển, chưa thực sự khiến người đọc phải wow
- Các nhân vật trong truyện tuy nổi bật về nét tính cách, nhưng thực sự chưa có một nhân vật nào được đào sâu về mặt tâm lý. Nhiều nhât chắc là Naoko khi nhớ về người anh trai Koichi đã mất, nhưng cũng thoáng qua. Có lẽ đây cũng là một sự trade-off với việc giữ một góc nhìn kể chuyện khách quan và mang tính cung cấp thông tin mà tác giả lựa chọn.

Mình đã rất băn khoăn nên cho sách 3 hay 4 sao, nhưng cuối cùng vẫn để 4 sao. Vì rõ ràng không nên dùng góc nhìn hiện đại để đánh giá một tác phẩm đã ra mắt từ rất lâu rồi. Có thể những di sản mà tác phẩm và tác giả để lại suốt mấy chục năm là điều tạo nên những sự quen thuộc mà mình nhận thấy khi thưởng thức sách. Kết lại thì, một cuốn sách đáng đọc với một trải nghiệm đáng giá ❤️",4,0 likes,23
review_4775376974,Nhung Hong,"Jun 11, 2022","Khi đọc nửa đầu của cuốn sách, mình cảm thấy hơi “buồn ngủ”.. Nửa đầu chuyện không có chút căng thẳng, kịch tính hay chi tiết nào mới lạ cả, tất cả chỉ đơn thuần là “kể” lại việc làm hằng ngày của các khách trọ trong nhà khách “Mẹ Ngỗng”. Mình ước gì bác Keigo đã khai thác các chi tiết về địa điểm và thời tiết tốt hơn để độc giả có thể cảm nhận được sự u ám, lạnh lẽo nơi núi tuyết. Mình cảm thấy có một sự “không tròn vẹn” ở phần đầu này. Phải thành thật là khi gập những cuốn truyện lại, mình quên hết các chi tiết và không còn nhớ chút gì ngoài việc Naoko rủ Makoto đi tới khách sạn.

Cao trào nằm ở nửa sau của cuốn truyện, tình tiết được đẩy lên nhanh hơn, không gấp gáp nhưng cũng đã để lại dấu ấn trong lòng người đọc. Dù là án lồng án, bác Keigo vẫn đưa ra lời giải thích thỏa đáng cho từng chi tiết, từ địa điểm, diễn biến nội tâm của nhân vật cho đến phương thức gây án. Điểm độc đáo và thu hút sự tò mò của độc giả trong “Vụ án mạng ở nhà khách núi Hakuba” là những ám hiệu, mật mã thông qua bài đồng dao “Mẹ Ngỗng”. Mình rất ấn tượng với việc bác Keigo đã sáng tạo mật mã từ bài “Mẹ Ngỗng”, một sự kì bí, lạ lùng và đáng sợ đã được tạo ra.

Tuy vậy, phương pháp “phá án” của Naoko và Makoto cũng khá đơn giản, chỉ đơn thuần là lắng nghe và “lắp ráp” các chi tiết được nghe kể cũng như tìm hiểu về bài đồng dao. Mình đã mong đợi một chút gì đó bùng nổ hơn. Nói thêm về cảnh phá án, khi đọc tới đoạn này, mình cảm giác như đang đọc Conan phiên bản truyện chữ vậy, đầu mình vẽ lên hình ảnh Conan phá án luôn. Hơn nữa, các lập luận cũng còn hơi “non” và dài dòng nên khi đọc mình cảm thấy hơi loạn, nhưng dù sao, về cuối mọi chuyện cũng được giải quyết một cách ổn thỏa. Plot twist là một điều không thể thiếu trong các tác phẩm của bác Keigo nên mình cảm thấy các nút thắt tưởng chừng như được gỡ hết ra nhưng lại vẫn còn một nút thắc nữa, tưởng chừng như đã kết thúc nhưng lại vẫn còn dang dở.

Mình chấm quyển này 3.5/5 - khá phân vân giữa 3 và 4 sao trên Goodreads nhưng quyết định cho 3 thôi z.. Nhìn chung, đây là một vụ án đơn giản, không có tình tiết nào quá nổi trội. Và cũng vì không quá kì vọng vào cuốn truyện này nên mình cảm thấy đây vẫn là một cuốn ổn, phù hợp với những bạn thích trinh thám cổ điển, đọc để giải trí.",3,0 likes,23
review_4342748535,Đặng Nhật Vũ,"Nov 17, 2021","** spoiler alert ** * Tóm tắt nội dung:
Naoko, một sinh đai học, vào năm ngoái đã nhận tin anh trai tự sát ở một nhà khách ở Hakuba. Kết luận “Tự sát” được cảnh sát đưa ra vì căn phòng hoàn toàn kín lúc thi thể được phát hiện. Trước đó, anh đã gửi cho cô một tấm bưu thiếp với nội dung “Mẹ Maria về nhà khi nào?”.
Nhà khách này mỗi năm đều có một nhóm khách giống nhau đến lưu trú. Naoko quyết định quyết định chọn thời điểm đúng 1 năm sau để quay lại nhà khách điều tra về cái chết của anh trai. Đi cùng Naoko là người bạn học Makoto.
Điểm đặc biệt của nhà khách “Mẹ Ngỗng” là mỗi phòng đếu được trang trí một tấm gỗ khắc nội dung một bài đồng dao Mẹ Ngỗng. Ấn giấu sau bài đồng dao này là mật mã dẫn đến quá khứ được dấu kín.
* Điểm hay:
- Yếu tố trinh thám đặc sắc, cốt truyện ban đầu tưởng là đơn giản nhưng đọc đến cuối thì quả là cồng kềnh không tưởng. Án chồng án, twist chồng twist, mật mã gồm ít nhất 9 đoạn đồng dao Mẹ Ngỗng, thêm một bức tượng mẹ Maria và cả truyện dân gian Celtic nữa. lúc xuất bản tác phẩm này thì tác giả mới 28 tuổi thôi, thực sự kinh ngạc. 3 án mạng trong 3 năm liên tiếp, cộng thêm án mạng của chủ nhân trước đây của nhà khách Mẹ Ngỗng. Twist thì ngay đầu mấy chục trang đã có một cú mạnh, đến sau khi phá án và tìm ra hung thủ rồi thì vẫn còn một cơ số dồn dập tới trang cuối cùng.
- Hung thủ của các vụ án khó đoán và manh mối để tìm ra hung thủ được cài cắm thực sự bất ngờ.
- Mạch truyện được dẫn dắt tốt, những bí ẩn đều kích thích người đọc động não suy nghĩ.
*Điểm chưa hay:
Tác giả dày công xây dựng một cuốn sách cồng kềnh các chi tiết nhưng 2 điểm nên tập trung nhất là mật mã giải bài đồng dao Mẹ Ngỗng và vụ án trong phòng kín của anh trai Naoko thì không đặc sắc lắm. Mọi người không nên tin vào lới giới thiệu mặt sau “Một kiệt tác trinh thám về mật mã và phòng kín” nha, cần hạ thấp kỳ vọng để được trải nghiệm tốt hơn.

Mình review sách và phim tại:
https://www.instagram.com/rosiereview...

Mình đọc 150 trang đầu trong vòng hơn 1 tuần nhưng đọc 200 trang cuối chỉ trong 1 đêm. Mình đã bị oải thật sự, đã có chút thất vọng và hờn dỗi (😛) rằng ""Trời ơi tại sao cuốn này lại lê thê vậy hả trời"". Ban đầu mình đoán ""Chắc cuốn này rate 2.5 quá"" mà may sao. Nửa sau sách đã cứu vớt tất cả và mang trả lại một Keigo sensei thông minh, sắc lạnh, tỉnh táo lại cho mình. Mặc dù thời kì đầu này bút lực của bác vẫn ở tầm trung và quy mô vụ án nhỏ, thiên về phá án kiểu cổ điển nhiều hơn, nhưng chí ít thì nó không đơn điệu.

""Vụ án mạng ở núi Hakuba"" có tầng bậc, có twist nhẹ (ơn giời). Chương cuối mang đến rất nhiều bất ngờ và mình thực sự nể khi Keigo ss lồng ghép được các chi tiết khéo léo, tài tình đến vậy. Mánh khoé tuy khá đơn giản nhưng bác rất biết cách đẩy đưa các câu thoại để tăng phần kịch tính. Trong lúc đọc chương phá án, mình thoạt nghĩ có phải bác đang hơi tham lam khi đan xen án mạng phòng kín lẫn án mạng trên cầu không. Ớ ầu, hoá ra nó có logic và ý đồ cả nha.

Duy chỉ có một đặc trưng mà mình phát điên lên ở hầu hết các tác phẩm của bác, đó là phần mở đầu quá trời lan man. 150 trang mà hơn 1 tuần mới lết xong là biết thế nào rồi :(( Nhưng đấy, các cụ dạy rồi, chớ thấy sóng cả mà ngã tay chèo, cố đọc qua phần dài dòng thì sẽ đến đoạn hay 🥴

👉🏻 Kết luận ngắn gọn lại là: Giống với Kairotei, nếu bạn là fan của bác hoặc thích đọc cho vui, thì cuốn này rất ổn. Nhưng mà nếu kì vọng, khao khát một cuốn trinh thám tâm lý xuất sắc, thì em nó không phải lựa chọn tốt nhất nhé.",3,0 likes,23

เป็นหนังสือนิทานสีทั้งเล่ม เป็นปกแข็งและมีปกสวมเป็นสีขาว กลัวเลอะมาก 55555 อ่านง่ายดีคะ เนื้อหาไม่ซับซ้อนเลย(ต่างจากงานเขียนอื่นๆ ของผู้เขียนท่านนี้) เนื้อเรื่องก็เป็นการจำลองสถานการณ์การประชุมร่วมกันของเหล่าซานต้าจากทั่วทุกมุมโลก และปมปัญหาคือ เนื่องจากซานต้าแห่งสหรัฐอเมริกากำลังจะเกษียณในเร็ววัน ทุกคนจึงต้องคัดเลือกซานต้าคนใหม่เข้ามาทำหน้าที่แทน แต่ดูเหมือนว่า ว่าที่ซานต้าคนใหม่ จะมีรูปลักษณ์ที่ผิดคาดไปจากความคิดของทุกคนมาก เพราะเธอเป็นผู้หญิง!

ถึงจะบอกว่าเล่มนี้เป็นนิทาน แต่ก็เป็นนิทานที่เหมาะทั้งสำหรับเด็กและผู้ใหญ่ เพราะมันแฝงประเด็นร่วมสมัยอย่างการถามหาความเท่าเทียมกันท่ามกลางความหลากหลายผ่านการถกเถียงกันระหว่างซานต้าที่มาจากแต่ละชนชาติ และบทสนทนาเหล่านั้นก็แสดงให้เห็นถึงมุมมองและความคิดที่แตกต่างกันออกไปต่อภาพลักษณ์ของซานต้า ซึ่งเป็นการถกเถียงกันที่สะท้อนให้เห็นถึงความเชื่อ ศาสนา ประวัติศาสตร์ สภาพสังคม และสถาบันครอบครัวที่มีส่วนเข้ามาเกี่ยวข้องอย่างหลีกเลี่ยงไม่ได้

ถ้ามองในแง่นิทาน นี่ไม่ใช่นิทานที่ทำให้เราว้าว แต่เรารู้สึกประทับใจช่องว่างในการเล่าเรื่องที่คุณเคโงะเลือกที่จะ 'ไม่เล่า' แล้วปล่อยให้บทสนทนาทำปฏิกิริยาในใจผู้อ่านเอง จังหวะการหยุดและการเล่าคือมืออาชีพสุดๆ ค่ะ

คุณป้าซานต้าคงเป็นงานเขียนชิ้นเดียวของ higashino keigo ที่ไม่มีคดีฆาตกรรม แต่ยังคงรักษาลายเซ็นต์เรื่องการตั้งคำถามเกี่ยวกับความเป็นพ่อแม่ได้เป็นอย่างดี

ประโยคจุกๆ ในเรื่อง เช่น
-น่าอิจฉาซานต้าญี่ปุ่นเนอะ เด็กไม่ค่อยเกิดกันแล้ว เลยไม่ต้องเหนื่อยส่งของขวัญมาก

-เป็นซานต้าญี่ปุ่นสบายเนอะแค่ซื้อเครื่องเล่นเกมให้เด็กก็พอใจ ไม่ต้องวุ่นวายเลือกของเล่นหลายๆ อย่างให้เหมาะกับเด็กหลายๆ วัย

-เด็กๆ ไม่เชื่อเรื่องมีซานต้า ไม่มีความฝันอะไรเหลืออีกแล้ว

-ทำไมถึงคิดว่าซานตาคลอสต้องเป็นผู้ชายเท่านั้น

-พ่อมีความหมายเท่ากับคนหาเงินเข้าบ้านเท่านั้น เวลาอยู่ที่บ้าน พ่อเป็นเพียงส่วนเกินในความรู้สึกของลูกๆ

-เด็กๆ รู้สึกว่า ถ้ามีเงินให้ ไม่ต้องมีพ่อก็ได้

ยังยืนยันว่าคุณป้าซานต้าเป็นงานเขียนใสๆ แต่เล่นกับประเด็นความเป็นพ่อแม่ได้ดี เชื่อว่าแฟนคลับคุณเคโงะจะชอบผลงานชิ้นนี้ และภาพวาดประกอบทั้งเรื่องน่ารักมากเลย!",0,,24

review_4634102624,Look A Breathe,"Mar 27, 2022","รีวิว คุณป้าซานต้า (サンタのおばさん)

ณ ที่แห่งหนึ่ง ที่ๆเด็กรอคอยในวันคริสต์มาส ที่มีคุณลุงซานต้าใจดี เอาของขวัญมาวางให้ แล้วเด็กๆก็ตื่นขึ้นมาพร้อมความรู้สึก

“เซอร์ไพรส์”


หนังสือเล่มนี้เป็นหนังสือสั่งไว้ก่อนแล้วค่อยรอได้สินค้า ซึ่งในไม่ช้า วันนี้ก็มาถึง วันที่คุณป้าซานต้ามาถึงบ้านแล้วค่ะ เราแอบรู้สึกตื่นเต้น เหมือนย้อนกลับไปวัยเด็กที่เคยคิดว่า ถ้าผู้หญิงเป็นซานต้าจะเป็นยังไงนะ

“ซานต้าคือตัวแทน
ของความเสมอภาคและเท่าเทียม
ที่ไม่มีแบ่งเขาแบ่งเรา
แบ่งสีผิว หรือแบ่งเพศกัน”


ซานต้าอิตาลีรีบเดินทางมาประชุมเกี่ยวกับซานต้า และระหว่างทางก็ได้พบผู้หญิงคนหนึ่งที่บอกว่า จะเดินทางไปที่เดียวกัน ซานต้าอิตาลีจึงพาเดินไปส่ง แต่เมื่อไปถึง เธอกลับหายตัวไปอย่างลึกลับ


ในขณะที่รอประธาน ซานต้าทุกคนก็มีประชุมกันว่า ประธานจะหาซานต้าอเมริกาคนใหม่มาทำหน้าที่แทน และเริ่มคุยกันถึงหน้าที่ของซานต้า และแอบแหย่ซานต้าญี่ปุ่นว่า เด็กน้อยลง ดังนั้น เด็กก็ไม่ต้องการซานต้าอีกแล้ว


ในขณะที่พูดคุยถกเถียงกันอยู่นั้น ซานต้าประธานเดินเข้ามาพร้อมแนะนำซานต้าที่มาทำหน้าที่แทนคือ ผู้หญิงคนนั้น ดังนั้น เริ่มมีการถกเถียงกันเกิดขึ้น โดยซานต้าญี่ปุ่นบอกว่า ซานต้าเป็นตัวแทนของพ่อ แต่เดี๋ยวนี้ ลูกๆแทบไม่ให้ความสำคัญของพ่อเลย เพราะคิดว่า พ่อคือแค่ตัวหาเงิน ส่วนแม่หลายคนก็ชอบทำร้ายลูก


และซานต้าหลายคนก็เริ่มถกเถียงกัน จนกระทั่ง เสียงสวรรค์ของซานต้าผู้หญิงอย่างเจสสิก้าก็ดังขึ้น ร้องเพลง เพื่อยุติเรื่องที่เถียง


เจสสิก้าชวนทุกคนกินชากับคุกกี้ก่อน ซานต้าก็ถามเธอว่า ทำไเธอมาสมัครเป็นซานต้า เธอบอกว่า ลูกชายเธอชื่อทอมมี่สมัครให้ เพราะหลังจากพ่อของทอมมี่เสีย ฉันสัญญากับลูกว่าจะเป็นทั้งพ่อและแม่ เธอก็เลยบอกกับทุกคนว่า ความเป็นจริงแล้ว พ่อกับแม่เป็นสิ่งสำคัญ และซานต้าทุกคนก็ยอมให้เธอทำงานนี้

เมื่อเจสสิก้าเริ่มงานวันแรก ทุกอย่างก็ผ่านไปด้วยดี และเธอก็ตัดสินใจจะแต่งงานใหม่ ซึ่งเมื่อทุกคนเข้าสู่ประชุมว่า ซานต้าสามารถแต่งงานใหม่ได้ไหม ทุกคนก็ลงความเห็นกันว่า ได้


เรื่องราวนี้ถือว่า จบลงแบบน่ารัก และทำให้เราหันมามองว่า เรื่องราวนี้ยังแฝงสไตล์ของเคโงะในการจิกกัดถึงสถาบันครอบครัวว่า จริงๆแล้วยังสำคัญอยู่หรือเปล่า แต่เรากล้าพูดว่า ในใจลึกๆของเด็กทุกคน คิดว่า ครอบครัวคือพื้นฐานสำคัญของความรัก

“ความรักที่ดูเหมือนจะเริ่มต้น
คือต้องสนใจมองมาที่ครอบครัวนี้
หากพ่อแม่มีเวลาให้พอดี
ลูกคงมีความสุขถาวรเกษมศรี
ความเป็นจริงของเด็กต้องการรัก
สุดประจักษ์พร้อมเวลาเอาใจใส่นี้
หากพ่อแม่พร้อมใจกันมอบมี
เด็กคงดีมีชีวิตสุขีเอย”


“ซานต้าเป็นตัวแทนของเด็กๆทุกคน
ที่อยากขอพรให้ครอบครัวอยู่พร้อมหน้าพร้อมตา
ในทุกวัน ทุกสถานที่และทุกเวลา”

หลังอ่านเล่มนี้เสร็จ เราคิดว่า หลายคนเริ่มมีความคิดที่เปลี่ยนไปเกี่ยวกับครอบครัว เพราะเรื่องราวที่สุดแสนอบอุ่นและอิ่มเอมใจดี




“ความรักอยู่รอบๆตัวเรา
และความรักจากคนรอบข้างที่ดีที่สุด
คือ ความรักจากครอบครัว
ครอบครัวคือพื้นฐานของรักอันยิ่งใหญ่”

It's a children's book, writen by Higashino Keigo and illustrated by Sugita Hiromi.

The Santa's of various countries meet to decide on the next American Santa, as the old one is retiring. He wants a woman to be his successor, and of course some of the other Santas aren't too pleased.

It's a cute book, giving a little bit of insight about various country's Christmas traditions to children, and talks about the love fathers and mothers have for their children. Of course a big theme is having a woman in a job that's usually done by men. There are some things I would nag about (Miss Santa gets married in the end, out of the blue), but it's a children's book... I'd probably read it to my child around Christmas time.",4,0 likes,24

review_3510297913,Thanawat,"Sep 18, 2020","ชอบและเต็มอ่มทุกครั้งที่ได้อ่านงานขนาดยาวของ Higashino Keigo เพราะมันการันตีเลยว่าจะได้อ่านดราม่าความสัมพันธ์ที่เข้มข้นของเหล่าตัวละครที่ได้รับการปู background เบื้องลึกเบื้องหลังอย่างอัดแน่น และแน่นอนว่า “ลาปลาซ” เล่มนี้ก็เช่นกัน

นิยายสืบสวนสอบสวนเล่มยาวสัญชาติญี่ปุ่นฝีมือ Higashino Keigo เล่มนี้ ผสมผสานดราม่า สืบสวนสอบสวน และ sci-fi อย่างกลมกล่อมตามสูตรเวทมนตร์ของ Keigo แต่สิ่งที่แตกต่างและชูความเป็น sci-fi ที่แหลมปรี๊ดออกมาคือการเพิ่มปรากฏการณ์ supra natural และความเป็น super human และให้กับตัวละคร ซึ่งมันแตกต่าจากงาน sci-fi อื่นๆ อย่างงานในซีรีย์กาลิเลโอของเจ้าตัว

เปิดเรื่องด้วยการตายที่ดูเป็นอุบัติเหตุของชายสูงวัยในเมืองออนเซ็นจากการสูดดมก๊าซไข่เน่า ที่ตามปกติแล้วเมืองออนเซนก็จะมีกลิ่นของก๊าซนี้เบาบางกระจายอยู่ในอากาศอยู่แล้ว แต่ชายสูงวัยคนนี้กลับบังเอิญพอเหมาะพอเจาะไปอยู่ในสถานที่ที่ก๊าซมากระจุกรวมตัวกันอย่างหนาแน่น
มันเพิ่มความน่าสงสัยขึ้นไปอีกเมื่อมีชายวัยกลางคนเสียชีวิตด้วยสาเหตุเดียวกันแต่ต่างสถานที่ต่างเวลา

ความลับและเงื่อนไขในการกำหนดสถานที่ และเวลาที่พอเหมาะพอเจาะที่พยากรณ์การรวมตัวของก๊าซไข่เน่าเป็นปริศนาที่นายตำรวจและนักวิทยาศาสตร์ผู้เชี่ยวชาญตัวเอกของเรื่องพยายามหาคำตอบ โดยมีตัวละคร “มาโดกะ” สาวน้อยแม่มดแห่งลาปลาซเป็นเงื่อนงำของการสืบสวน

ลาปลาซกล่าวว่า ถ้าสามารถล่วงรู้ปัจจัยในระดับอะตอมทั้งหมด ก็สามารถใช้กฎทางฟิสิกส์พยากรณ์เหตุการณ์ใดๆ ในอนาคตได้ แต่มันจะมีคนที่มีความสามารถในระดับในได้จริงหรือ

แน่นอนว่างานของ Keigo ต้องมีดราม่าตัวละครและความสัมพันธ์ที่ซับซ้อน
ในเรื่องนี้เป็นเรื่องของครอบครัวโปรดิวเซอร์หนังอัจริยะที่ลูกสาวฆ่าตัวตายด้วยก๊าซไข่เน่า จนภรรยาโดนลูกหลงเสียชีวิต ส่วนลูกชายคนเล็กต้องกลายเป็นเจ้าชายนิทรา
การรอดชีวิตของลูกชายเป็นคีย์สำคัญในการเดินเรื่อง

ช่วงแรกที่อ่านจะงงๆ เพราะมันมีปรากฏการณ์เหนือธรรมชาติเข้ามาเป็นตัวหลักจนรู้สึกว่า เอ๊ะ ปกติงานของเคโงะไม่ใช่แนวนี้นี่ แต่เมื่อเริ่มเข้าใจที่มาที่ไปเมื่อผ่านกลางๆ เล่มไป มันก็กลายเปลี่ยนไปเป็นการลุ้นอย่างสนุกว่าทริคทั้งหมดจะถูกเฉลยยังไง อะไรคือมูลเหตุจูงใจในการฆาตกรรม และการตายของทั้งสองคนมันมีความเกี่ยวข้องกันอย่างไร

เคโงะยังคงใส่ประเด็นทางสังคมสังคมและปัญหาครอบครัวของคนญี่ปุ่นไว้ในงานของตัวเองเสมอ และทำให้มันเห็นภาพได้ชัดดูไม่ได้ห่างไกลจากความรับรู้

ความหนา 580 หนา แถมเป็นการเริ่มอ่านซีรีส์ชุดใหม่ของคุณเคโงะอีก... ต้องหายใจเข้าฮึดสู้พอสมควร

ขอบอกให้เตรียมใจไว้ก่อนเลยตรงนี้ว่า เล่มนี้ใช้ตัวละครเปลืองมากกกกก
อ่านไปถึงหน้า 132 แล้วก็ยังมีตัวละครใหม่โผล่มาไม่หยุดไม่หย่อนในทุกๆ บท

ความจริงตัวละครเยอะก็ไม่เป็นไรหรอกค่ะ แต่เรื่องนี้ใช้ ""มุมมองตัวละคร"" เปลืองมากกกกก เช่นกัน
อ่านแล้วเวียนหัวมากว่า ใครเป็นคนเล่า คนนี้รู้ถึงแค่ไหน คนนั้นรู้ถึงแค่ไหน ว่าแต่คนที่เล่านี่เค้าเป็นใคร แล้วเกี่ยวข้องยังไงกับผู้ตายนะ?

เรื่องนี้มีคนรับบท ""นักสืบ"" มากถึง 3 คน แล้วเรื่องก็เล่าจากทั้งสามมุมมองเลยค่ะ
ต้องจำเยอะเหมือนกันว่าใครสืบไปถึงไหน ใครรู้อะไร ใครเกี่ยวข้องกับใครอย่างไร แล้วอะไรที่คนที่สืบไปแต่ยังไม่รู้

คนที่ 1 เป็นตำรวจ ที่เข้ามาตามสืบคดีเพราะได้รับไหว้วานจากคุณยายในบ้านพักคนชราระดับห้าดาว บอกว่าไม่ไว้ใจลูกสะใภ้ตัวเอง เพราะดูก็รู้ว่าแต่งงานเพื่อหวังสมบัติสามี(ลูกชายของคุณยายเอง)

คนที่ 2 เป็นอาจารย์ มหาวิทยาลัย ในฐานะผู้เชี่ยวชาญด้านธรณี เขาต้องอธิบายว่าน้ำพุร้อนเกิดจากอะไร โอากาสที่จะเกิดอุบัติเหตุแบบนี้ในเมืองน้ำพุร้อนเป็นไปได้จริงหรือไม่ ชาวเมืองจะเฝ้าระวังไม่ให้เกิดอุบัติเหตุกับนักท่องเที่ยวได้อย่างไร
แต่เพราะไปพบเจอบางอย่างเข้า อาจารย์อดรนทนไม่ได้ ต่อมขี้สงสัยถูกเล่นงาน ก็เลยจับพลัดจับผลูต้องกลายเป็นนักสืบจำเป็น ไม่งั้นมันก็จะคาใจเจ้าตัวต่อไป

คนที่ 3 เป็นวัยรุ่นหญิงปริศนาที่มีพลังพิเศษ

บอกตามตรงว่า 200 หน้าแรก เรื่องแทบจะไม่เดินค่ะ ดังนั้นต้องอดทนขั้นสุดจริงๆ
พอหลุดจาก 200 หน้านี้ไปได้ จังหวะการเล่าจะเร่งสปีดติดคันเร่งทันที (ดังนั้น ต้องอดทนข้ามผ่านช่วง 1/3 ของเล่มไปให้ได้นะ)

ความรู้สึกหลังหลุด 200 หน้าแรกไปได้ ก็รู้สึก.... โหหหห.... มาแล้วๆ มีความซับซ้อนที่คาดไม่ถึงซัดเข้ามาเป็นระยะๆ
แต่อ่านไปเรื่อยๆ ก็.... เอ๊ะ เอ๊ะ เอ๊ะ... โอ้...

นึกว่าเล่มนี้จะฉีกไปเป็นแนว ""พลังพิเศษเหนือธรรมชาติ"" หลุดไปเขียนแนวเวทย์มนตร์เต็มขั้นอะไรทำนองนั้นเสียอีก
แต่คุณเคโงะก็สามารถตลบทุกอย่างกลับมาอธิบายให้ดูวิทยาศาสตร์ได้ทั้งนั้นเช่นเคยล่ะค่ะ

สิ่งที่ดีงามที่สุดในเล่มนี้เห็นจะเป็นคู่ความสัมพันธ์ของ ""คุณบอดี้การ์ดร่างยักษ์กับคุณหนูแม่มดเอาแต่ใจ""

Mặc dù bản thân tự biết một sự thật là, không tác giả nào có thể đem tới toàn những tác phẩm xuất sắc hết, đôi lúc sẽ hơi xuống tay hoặc thay đổi không hợp ý người đọc, tớ vẫn theo từng cuốn của tác giả vì cái nhìn đa chiều về những vấn đề Keigo đặt ra trong tác phẩm của mình.
Lần này cũng thế, ‘Ma nữ của Laplace’ lại đưa ra một tình huống bất ngờ và kì lạ khác, đừng bị đánh lừa bởi từ ‘ma nữ’ nhé anh em, bởi đây không phải một cuốn truyện kinh dị đâu.

Cuốn này phần đầu hơi chậm, không chán mà chậm anh em ạ, nhưng cách kể chuyện của Keigo vẫn giữ tớ tiếp tục đọc, vì tò mò về những điều bí ẩn bên trong nó. Án mạng, những nhân vật thân thế kì lạ dần xuất hiện, hay cả những nỗ lực điều tra có chút quẩn quanh của các nhân viên điều tra, mọi thứ có chút quen thuộc nhỉ? Nhưng điều khiến tớ tiếp tục đọc này chính là cái thôi thúc muốn biết về những điều lạ lùng và trùng hợp đến kì quái diễn ra trong đó. Câu chuyện lần này pha lẫn một chút bí ẩn và một chút khoa học, về một chủ đề còn nhiều điều mới mẻ, rằng liệu có thật là chúng ta có thể dự đoán trước được tương lai hay không? Nếu đơn thuần dựa vào các thuật toán máy tính và công nghệ khoa học hay vệ tinh, mọi thứ đã rõ ràng, nhưng nếu là chính tự bộ não của con người thực hiện thì sao?
Câu chuyện càng về sau càng trở nên hấp dẫn, tớ vẫn nhớ tối hôm ấy tớ đã cố thức tới khuya để đọc hết đoạn kết, và gấp sách lại, cảm giác hài lòng khiến tớ ngủ thật ngon.
So sánh một chút thì em này có chút màu sắc tương đồng với ‘Hoa mộng ảo’ ở những điều bí ẩn hơi creepy, cũng như ‘Ngôi nhà của người cá say ngủ’ ở những nghiên cứu và lí thuyết khoa học, vật lý và toán học. Em nó không phải kiểu hồi hộp hấp dẫn trên từng trang viết như ‘Trước khi nhắm mắt’ hay ‘Tên của trò chơi là bắt cóc’, nhưng độ lôi cuốn cũng không hề kém đâu anh em.

Laplace's Witch by Keigo Higashino, is a solidly written half mystery and half Sci-Fi hybrid, it does provide an entertaining enough read. And I do like how the author introduces us to the theory of Laplace's Demon and how he uses this theory in his murder mystery.

Here's the wiki information about Laplace's Demon:






The story begins with an ex-cop meeting a mysterious beautiful young girl and a female secretary who acts as the young girl's protector. During the time the ex-cop is hired as the girl's bodyguard, he notices a series of unexplainable phenomena happening around the girl.

Meanwhile, a successful film producer is found dead by inhaling toxic gas in a hot spring. The death is ruled out as an accident but soon enough an actor is also found dead in the exact same way. For twice a time, a young girl had been seen near the scenes of the 'accidents'. So, where is the connection between those mysterious death and the so-called 'Laplace's Witch' who seems to have unexplained power?

The opening and the ending part are the good parts of the story, the murder mystery is very slow paced but I do like the explanation. Still...the middle part....it is just goddamn boring! I know it's a half Sci-Fi story but I can't believe how the author can make scientific details look so DULL!

Another reviewer mentioned the 'scientific details' offered by Keigo Higashino are merely pseudo science and, although my scientific knowledge is by no mean good, I still agree with this pseudo science criticism.

I mean..........the 'Laplace's Witch' in the story can I'm not buying it.

I don't have much to say about the characters, I don't care much about them, although the so-called 'Laplace's Witch', the young boy who had been in a coma and the man who lost his wife and daughter in a tragic accident are all very interesting characters. I enjoy their backstories very much.

As to the ending, like I'd mentioned above I do like it, still I find the author overdid a bit when he allows one of his main characters to lecture the killer and us readers about how the society is a complicated collection of countless different individuals and wonders are created by those seemingly insignificant individuals instead of the high and mighty smart/rich/talented people.

Ah, that's exactly one of the main things I dislike about this author,

Still, I am glad that this time the seemingly cunning and manipulative 'Laplace's Witch' isn't painted as a mere heartless bitch, like the main female character from .",3,,25

Như thường lệ mình không đọc giới thiệu gì trước cả nên cũng tò mò không biết là ma nữ nghĩa là sao. Phần đầu hơi rườm rà, đọc cảm giác không lôi cuốn như thường thấy ở Higashino Keigo. Cho đến phần sau, khi đã rõ ma nữ Laplace nghĩa là gì, thì mới bắt đầu cuốn hút, nếu đọc ban đêm thì sẽ cố đọc cho sang cả ngày mới mới thôi.

Song có lẽ mình không viết nhiều về quyển này. Cảm giác hơi giống các vụ án trong Conan, với sự ám ảnh kỳ lạ của người Nhật dẫn đến động cơ của mọi tội ác. Mình nghĩ có thể dễ nhìn ra “công thức” thường thấy ở các truyện khác của Keigo trong quyển này: những nhân vật sẽ lần lượt xuất hiện, tưởng không liên quan nhưng đều có liên kết với nhau; người tò mò với những bí ẩn và thôi thúc muốn giải nó không phải lúc nào cũng là thanh tra viên mà là một người khác; và cuối cùng là luôn lồng ghép nhiều kiến thức của một lĩnh vực nào đó vào câu chuyện điều tra, phá án, tìm câu trả lời cho các bí ẩn.",4,5 likes,25

Professor Aoe pretty much knows everything now, for me, it's only fair the Nakaoka gets to know too! He worked so hard on the case! So close!

If the rating of a story depends on the characters... then the researchers at the Mathematic Institute and U-hara Madoka, and especially Ms. Kirimiya, dragged down the rating to 3 for me. Though I know that withholding information is one of the obstacles in solving the mystery, but it just annoys me. Then again, there's no such thing as a free lunch... I guess, I just feel sorry for Nakaoka. Prof. Aoe and Madoka's bodyguard Takeo sure are my favourite characters. It's a shame that Takeo didn't get as much scenes as the other characters.

But if the rating depends on it's plot and how it's structured... then ok, it's a 4. It got this sci-fi going on and mystery detective investigation that I like. I love the twist at the second half of the story concerning the motive. It's pretty obvious who is responsible for the crimes before I got halfway through the book, so the twist is satisfying to.

๑)
หนังสือทำรูปเล่มมาเปิดอ่านลำบาก คือสันหนา แต่หน้าแคบ ต้องออกแรงกางเยอะ เมื่อรวมกับน้ำหนักหนังสือ เวลาอ่านนาน ๆ จะปวดนิ้วและข้อมือ ผมเป็นคนที่ไวต่อรายละเอียดอย่างพวกรูปเล่มหรือขนาดตัวอักษรเป็นพิเศษ
ไม่ใช่ความสามารถพิเศษนะครับ อันนี้เป็นที่สังขาร

๒)
อ่านแล้วนึกไปถึงหนังสือสองเล่มของผู้เขียน คือ #เจตนาร้าย กับ #อวตาร วิธีการสืบสวนจากการอ่านบันทึก คล้ายกับเรื่องเจตนาร้าย เป็นพล็อตลวงที่ชวนติดตามดี ส่วนวิทยาศาสตร์ในเรื่องอวตารนั้น ฟังดูธรรมดามากในปัจจุบัน แต่ถ้านึกถึงสมัยที่เริ่มตีพิมพ์เรื่องนี้ที่ญี่ปุ่นเมื่อ 28 ปีก่อนถือว่าล้ำมาก
ลาปลาซก็เช่นกัน สิ่งที่เกิดขึ้นในเรื่อง (ตีพิมพ์ปี 2015) อาจจะเป็นเรื่องปกติในอีก 50 ปีข้างหน้าก็ได้ ถ้าไม่อดตายเพราะโควิดเสียก่อน มารอดูกันได้เลย

๓)
ชื่อเรื่องฉบับภาษาไทย คือ #ลาปลาซทฤษฎีฆ่าเหนือธรรมชาติ แต่พออ่านจบแล้วผมชอบชื่อเรื่อง #แม่มดแห่งลาปลาซ ตามในต้นฉบับมากกว่าแฮะ ฟังดูมีพลังลึกลับดี แต่อาจเพราะถ้าตั้งชื่อว่า แม่มด จะทำให้คนอ่านเข้าใจผิดว่าเป็นเวทย์มนต์แบบแฮรี่ พอตเตอร์หรือเปล่า อีกอย่างหนังสือแนวนี้ #ถ้าจะให้ขายดีมักมีคำอัปมงคล เช่นคำว่า ฆ่างี้ ฆาตกรรมงี้ ตายงี้ มรณะงี้ สนพ.น่าจะชอบแบบนี้กัน

๔)
เล่มนี้มีภาคพิเศษ ฉบับภาษาญี่ปุ่นตีพิมพ์เมื่อปี 2018 เป็นภาคแยกที่เล่าเรื่องราวก่อนถึงเหตุการณ์ใน #แม่มดแห่งลาปลาซ แต่เนื้อหาออกไปทางดราม่ามากกว่า เรื่องราวในตอนพิเศษนี้ สำหรับคนมีครอบครัวอย่างผมอ่านแล้วก็จะอิน ๆ น้ำตาซึมหน่อย
มานึก ๆ ดูความสามารถในการคาดการณ์ล่วงหน้านี้ เป็นพล็อตให้เล่นได้อีกหลายประเด็นมาก อยู่ที่ว่าผู้เขียนจะเอามาเล่นต่อเป็นซีรีส์หรือเปล่า ตัวละครหลักก็ยังอยู่ครบ

Như mọi lần, Keigo vẫn có khiếu kể chuyện, trừ 40 trang cuối thì cuốn này hay 🙄

Một tác phẩm hiếm hoi có “happy ending” theo nghĩa nào đó, nhưng lại giống một bộ drama kết hợp giữa phim của Marvel với Drama Hàn. Bởi vậy cũng dễ hiểu vì sao nó được dựng thành phim.

Nói chung là đừng trông chờ vào bom tấn cỡ Bạch Da Hành hoặc những cuốn khai thác nội tâm sâu sắc như X, Naoko, Thánh Giá Rỗng.

Với cá nhân mình thì quả là đầu voi đuôi chuột. Quan trọng hơn, trong số đã xb ở Việt Nam thì đây là cuốn đầu tiên của Keigo có lý do giết người NHẢM NHÍ, ít ra đối với mình là thế.

review_2999737716,Miles Bader,"Jan 18, 2020","The plotting is intricate, it's quite a while before you have any idea what's really going on, and it's a fun ride finding out. However, the ending isn't so strong; it feels like everything just kind of .... peters out (with the caveat that the last sentence is amazing!).

The characters are appealing and both act and talk like real people.

The semi-SF aspect is interesting. At first it adds a lot of cool twists, and really keeps you guessing, but eventually I think it sort of backfires, by making certain characters too powerful. One of Hisashino's general strengths is his characters' limitations: they aren't supergeniuses, they get confused, miss clues, stumble, and work their way slowly forward (along with the reader). That's all here in this book too, but a little more diluted, and the SF stuff adds a bit too much ""then magic happens"" to the proceedings.

In the end I'd call this a solid effort, but not spectacular.",3,1 like,25

review_3475908508,Người Qua Đường,"Aug 03, 2020","** spoiler alert ** Đang mải xem phim nên mỗi ngày chỉ đọc một chút. Kết quả là cảm xúc thay đổi xoành xoạch sau từng đoạn...
Đầu tiên (sau sự tò mò vốn không bao giờ thiếu kho đọc các tác phẩm của bác Keigo) là cảm giác thông cảm, thương cảm, đồng cảm với tay đạo diễn Asakuma (ko đúng lắm mà lười check quá, đêm rồi :v). Hồi hôm mới đọc được câu: ""Hãy đọc quyển sách bạn yêu thích nhất đầu tiên vì có thể bạn sẽ không còn dịp làm điều đó nữa đâu"". Đại loại mình hiểu là hãy dành thời gian để làm/ quan tâm thứ quan trọng nhất trước. Rồi cái phim đang xem có đoạn bạn nữ chính cố gắng tìm hiểu về người yêu đã mất của mình, càng tìm hiểu càng đau lòng vì phát hiện ra anh rất rất yêu cô. Cô nghĩ thà biết được anh không yêu mình thì còn đỡ đau khổ hơn là biết tình yêu của anh to lớn đến vậy (Phim One day or Some day). Ông đạo diễn này cũng ở tình huống y xì thế. Hic, mình đọc mà buồn hộ ổng, vội sụt sịt bảo người chồng phương xa là em yêu anh lắm huhu. Chắc hắn cũng thấy choáng váng tâm can tưởng mình bị đập đầu vô đâu...

Bùm cái sang đoạn tiếp theo thì tèn ten tất cả chỉ là bịa -___- đúng là không thể tin những gì viết trên mạng đượcccccc.

Cuốn này đọc vừa có mùi hư cấu lại vừa rất khoa học (theo con mắt của người yêu khoa học nửa mùa đó là mình :)) ). Ban đầu việc dự đoán của Madoka và Kento có vẻ thần bí. Họ dường như biết trước tương lai. Nhưng dưới góc độ vật lý, điều ấy lại hết sức bình thường. Chỉ cần có đủ dữ liệu, ta hoàn toàn có thể dự đoán chính xác. Vấn đề là khi một người có khả năng xử lý thông tin siêu việt thế thì họ không tự ý thức được mà cho rằng nó là bí mật tâm linh gì đó mà thôi. Đọc tới Laplace cùng cái thuyết phân tử gì đấy của ông thấy cũng giống triết lý nhân quả của nhà Phật. Có lẽ nắm được nhân quả thì tiên tri cũng chẳng khó khăn gì. Vậy khả năng này liệu có phải một ""món quà"" không? Dường như là không. Cả Madoka và Kento đều trở nên u ám khi nhìn ra tương lai thế giới hiện đại. Giống như nhân vật nữ trong cuốn Mộ đom đóm của Quỷ cổ nữ mình đọc hồi nhỏ. Hồi ấy khá là khó hiểu tại sao cổ lại đau khổ khi biết trước tương lai đến vậy. Mà sau này thì mình nhận ra rồi, họ chỉ biết trước tương lai chứ không có cách nào thay đổi nó. Tương lai đến tận cùng là một nỗi đau khổ lớn không cách nào biến cải chỉ bởi một người :-<

Đan xen vào đó là câu chuyện về gia đình. Một tiến sĩ Aoe giàu tình cảm lại lạc lõng trong chính gia đình mình vì vợ và con đều mải miết với ti vi, điện thoại. Một đạo diễn nổi tiếng bị khiếm khuyết ""bản năng làm cha"". Tình yêu tình thương ta thường ca ngợi rút cuộc là một chức năng trong não mà nếu thiếu đi phần não đó thì con người không còn cái gọi là lương tri nữa.
Xét tới tình tiết vụ án thì không đặc sắc gì nhiều nhưng mình vẫn rất thích cuốn này vì đề cập đến nhiều thứ mình quan tâm.",5,1 like,25

review_2515065896,Mizuki,"Sep 01, 2018","Fated (it is my own translation, I'm not sure it is correct) is a disappointing melodrama by Keigo Higashino. I got so bored in the middle of the story that I skimmed to read the ending...and then I was like ""Oh, that's it. That's the ending. It is not bad, but it is not very exciting neither. No point in reading any further.""

This novel still carries plenty of Keigo Higashino's trademark problems when characters, story and writing is considered. I feel nothing for any of the characters--not saying that these characters are badly written, but they are just not...interesting. The murder mystery is half-baked as best, and the story itself is............as flat and as tasteless as reading a piece of news from a newspaper.



*sighs* I just need to rant about Keigo Higashino's tone whenever he is writing his novels: he inserts too much Big Talk about fate and destiny and human nature and the dark side of the society and whatnot in order to impress his audience---and it works because everyone and their mother is praising Keigo Higashino for being such a master novelist but I am not buying any of these, I hate being lectured by this guy and I think most of his novels are overrated and freaking boring.

If I had better books to read, I won't pick Higashino's books up. Case closed.",2,8 likes,26

นิยายสืบสวนสอบสวนของ Keigo เล่มนี้ดำเนินเรื่องเนิบๆ บนพื้นฐานของความสัมพันธ์ล้วนๆ
เรื่องราวชีวิตคู่ขนานของชายหนุ่มมากความสามารถสองคน เพื่อนร่วมชั้นสมัยวัยเด็ก ที่มีสภาพแวดล้อมในการใช้ชีวิตต่างกันราวฟ้ากับเหว

คนหนึ่งเป็นลูกชายประธานบริษัทยักษ์ใหญ่
ส่วนอีกคนหนึ่งเป็นลูกชายนายตำรวจธรรมดาๆ
คนหนึ่งเติบโตขึ้นเป็นแพทย์สาขาประสาทวิทยา
อีกคนหนึ่งเติบโตขึ้นเป็นนายตำรวจชั้นสืบสวน
ชีวิตของทั้งสองคนเกี่ยวพันกันด้วยผู้หญิงอีกคน

เปิดเรื่องด้วยการตายของประธานบริษัทคนใหม่ แต่การตาย เป็นตายแบบวิธีที่โบราณมาก คือถูกหน้าไม้อาบยาพิษยิงเข้ากลางหลัง หน้าไม้ที่เป็นอาวุธที่ใช้ในการฆาตกรรม ดันเป็นอาวุธโบราณที่ประธานบริษัทคนเดิมสะสมไว้ แน่นอนว่าคนในครอบครัวของอดีตประธาน ต้องตกเป็นผู้ต้องสงสัยอย่างเลี่ยงไม่ได้

ทั้งสองหนุ่มจึงโคจรกลับมาพบกัน
คนหนึ่งในฐานะผู้ต้องสงสัย
อีกคนหนึ่งในฐานะตำรวจผู้รับผิดชอบคดี

ต้องบอกว่าเรื่องนี้ Keigo เดินเรื่องเนิบๆ พอสมควร เนื้อหาตรงกลางเล่ม อยู่กับการสืบหาข้อมูลที่ไม่หวือหวามากนัก การหักเหลี่ยมเฉือนคมชิงไหวชิงพริบก็มีไม่มาก มีเพียงอารมณ์ลุ้นกับเดา ว่าใครเป็นคนฆ่า และความลับของคำว่า ""โชคชะตา"" ที่เป็นชื่อเรื่องคืออะไร

Keigo ใช้ปมที่สลับซับซ้อนมากพอสมควร ในการผูกโยง ""โชคชะตา"" ด้วย ""ด้ายสีแดง""
อันที่จริงมันก็ค่อนข้างพอเหมาะพอเจาะพอสมควร ที่ตัวละครในเรื่องที่เคยมีอดีตร่วมกัน กลับมาประสบพบเจอเหตุการณ์ในปัจจุบันร่วมกันอีกครั้ง
สถานที่ปริศนาที่ชวนสงสัยคาใจคือ ""โรงพยาบาลอิฐ"" ที่ Keigo ใช้ในการเปิดเรื่อง และเป็นพื้นที่แห่งความทรงจำของตัวละคร ระหว่างที่อ่านมันชวนสงสัยว่ามันเกิดเหตุการณ์อะไรขึ้นที่โรงพยาบาลอิฐ และมันมาเกี่ยวข้องกับตัวละครแต่ละตัวอย่างไร
ตอนท้ายเล่มจึงรู้เฉลย ทั้งฆาตกร และความสัมพันธ์
เล่มนี้อาจจะไม่ได้หวือหวามาก แต่มันเต็มไปด้วยดราม่าของชีวิตและความสัมพันธ์ อ่านแล้วรู้สึกถึงการถ่ายทอดอารมณ์ความรู้สึกของตัวละครอย่างมาก ทั้งอึดอัด หงุดหงิด หมั่นไส้ และเมื่อท้ายที่สุดมาถึงจุดเฉลยกลับทำให้อมยิ้มมุมปากได้เฉยเลย",3,3 likes,26

ผู้แต่ง – ฮิงาชิโนะ เคโงะ (Keigo Higashino) เขียน ทินภาส พาหะนิชย์ แปล


ตัวละคร
วากุระ ยูซากุ
ฮิโนะ ซานาเอะ
อุริว อากิฮิโตะ
เอจิมะ มิซาโกะ


รีวิวหลังอ่าน

เป็นเรื่องที่เราอ่านไปก็เทียบหน้านักแสดงไป ฮ่าๆ โดยเฉพาะบทของอากิฮิโตะ มีบุโจวที่รัก หรือนาโอะฮิโตะแสดงนั่นเอง เรื่องนี้เป็นละครเมื่อปี 2004 เดี๋ยวถ้ามีโอกาสคงจะหาดูแหละจ้าาา อยากดูบุโจวที่รักจริงๆ

การเล่าเรื่องค่อนข้างเนิบช้า ชวนสงสัยว่าจะเกี่ยวโยงกันยังไง สุดท้ายก็รู้สึกว่าโชคชะตาเล่นตลกจริงๆ สมกับชื่อเรื่องที่ตั้งไว้ แอบคิดว่าปมในเรื่องมันใหญ่กว่าที่จะจบลงแค่นี้แหละ เหมือนจบแบบปลายเปิด นี่จนจบเรื่องก็ยังไม่รู้เรื่องของซานาเอะ (ที่เอ่ยถึงในบทนำ) อย่างละเอียดมากนัก แบบว่าก็ยังค้างคาใจ เดาไม่ค่อยได้ต่อไป

ส่วนจุดพีคที่เฉลยเรื่องราวโชคชะตานั้น ไม่เซอร์ไพรส์เรา เพราะเราดันเผลอใจไปเปิดอ่านตอนท้ายก่อนเอง กร๊ากกก เอาจริงๆ มันก็พีคแหละ แต่เรารู้สึกว่าพอไปเฉลยตอนท้ายๆ มันเลยไม่ค่อยพีค แบบเหมือนตอนท้ายๆ ทุกอย่างจบอย่างรวบรัดไปหมดเลยอ่ะ

มีคดีแทรกอยู่ในเรื่องด้วย ซึ่งถามว่าเดาคนร้ายได้ไหม เดาไม่ได้จ้าาา ถึงเดาไปก็ไม่น่าจะถูก เลยไม่อยากเดา ฮ่าๆๆๆ เพราะตัวละครเหมือนจะเยอะนะ แต่ก็ไม่ได้เยอะอะไรขนาดนั้น มาเยอะตอนเล่าช่วงหลังๆ มากกว่า ทำเอางงๆ ว่าใครเป็นใคร จำได้แค่ตัวละครหลักนั่นแหละนะ

แอบคิดว่าเรื่องนี้ถ้าดูเป็นละครอาจจะสนุกกว่าอ่านนิยายก็ได้มั้ง เราก็ไม่รู้เหมือนกัน รู้แต่ว่าตอนต้นถึงกลางเรื่องเล่าได้เนิบมาก ส่วนตอนท้ายก็รวบรัดและจบไปแบบรวดเร็วจริงๆ จนแบบว่าอยากให้ขยายช่วงท้ายอีกสักนิดจะดีกว่าจริงๆ นะ

ปกติเราไม่ค่อยอ่านนิยายของเคโงะ คือดูละครที่สร้างจากนิยายของเคโงะ แต่หนังสือเองนั้นกลับไม่ค่อยได้อ่าน เพราะมีออกมาเยอะจนเกินไป กร๊ากๆ ไม่ใช่ๆ เล่มนี้อาจจะเป็นเล่มแรกที่ได้อ่านด้วยซ้ำ ถ้าจำไม่ผิดนะ ก็ไม่รู้เหมือนกัน เพราะออกมาเยอะ แต่ส่วนใหญ่เราก็ดูละครไปแล้วทั้งนั้นเลย หรือบางเรื่องอาจจะยังไม่ได้ดู แต่ก็รู้จัก และตั้งใจว่าจะดูแหละ

ทั้งที่ไม่ได้มีอะไรเกี่ยวข้องกัน แต่ก็เป็นคนที่ตัวเองสนใจ ไม่ได้รู้สึกว่าเขามีเสน่ห์หรือแค้นเคืองใดๆ แล้วทำไมที่มองหน้ากันถึงได้รู้สึกหวั่นไหว-


เท่าที่ผ่านงานคุณนักเขียนมา จำได้ว่าผมประทับใจกับมิตรภาพแบบโบรแมนซ์ของตัวละครในงานของคุณเค้าอยู่สองเล่ม ซึ่งก็คือสองเล่มที่กล่าวไปแล้ว แต่ไม่มีเล่มไหนแม้ในสองเล่มนั้นก็เถอะที่จะฟุ้งฝันขนาดนี้ นี่ยังไม่รวมประโยคหวานหยดย้อยแบบแมนๆ หรือการตัดประโยคแบบชวนให้คิดลึกบางจุด (ซึ่งดูจงใจมาก ฝีมือพิสูจน์อักษรใช่หรือไม่ ยอมรับมา!) ซึ่งทั้งหมดทั้งมวลผมก็มองว่ามันน่ารักดีแหละนะ และก็ไม่รู้ว่าผู้เขียนคิดว่ามันจะเยอะไปหรือเปล่าเลยจบเรื่องด้วยประโยคที่ทำให้ความเพ้อ (เจ้อ) พวกนี้มันยังอยู่ในระดับกลางๆ ด้วย เจ๋งไปอีก

สุดท้ายก็จะยังคงพูดเหมือนเดิมว่า เคย์โงะซังจะยังเป็นอีกนักเขียนที่ผมจะหยิบมาอ่านเสมอถ้าไม่รู้จะอ่าน ""อะไร"" หรือเวลาอยากอ่าน ""อะไร"" ที่การันตรีความบันเทิงได้ประมาณนึง มากน้อยก็แล้วแต่รสนิยมและประสบการณ์ที่มีร่วมกับเรื่องนั้นๆ อ่ะเนอะครับ",3,,26

ตัวละครหลักมี 3 ตัว และตัวละครรายล้อมอีกมหาศาล อ่านไปก็ลุ้นไปกับความสัมพันธ์ที่โยงใยคนทั้งสามอยู่ รู้แหล่ะว่ามันต้องมีอะไรสักอย่าง แต่ไม่รู้หรอกว่าคุณเคโงะจะผูกเรื่องที่ไม่น่าจะเข้ากันเลยให้เข้ากันได้ยังไง คือโยงแบบ... ครอบจักรวาลมากค่ะ แต่อ่านแล้วก็... นะ โอเคร้ อย่างงั้นก็ได้

หยิบไปทำซีรีย์น่าจะสนุกดี เพราะคุณตัวละครชาย 2 ตัวหลักนี่คงต้องหน้าตาดีมาก คนนึงเป็นคุณหมอลุคสไตล์เจ้าชายเย็นชา กับอีกคนเป็นคุณตำรวจผิวเข้มผอมแต่มีกล้ามค่ะ

เวลาอ่านคุณเคโงะบรรยายวิธีคิดกับการกระทำของ 'มิซากิ' (นางเอก) เราจะทึ่งมาก เพราะมันผู้หญิงจริงๆ เลย อาการลังเลสับสนไม่แน่ใจ คือจังหวะ วิธีคิด และการตัดสินใจลงมือทำมันผู้หญิงสุดๆ อ่านแล้วทึ่งเหมือนเห็นคุณเคโงะไปสิงร่างนาง

เป็นนิยายแนวสืบสวนที่เล่นกับความซับซ้อนในด้านความสัมพันธ์ของตัวละคร คู่ขนานไปกับการตามหาตัวคนร้ายและแรงจูงใจ

เนื้อเรื่องกล่าวถึงการขับเคี่ยวแข่งขันระหว่างชายสองคนตั้งแต่เด็กจนโต คนหนึ่งเป็นหมอ อีกคนเป็นตำรวจ คนหนึ่งเป็นผู้ต้องสงสัย อีกคนเป็นตำรวจที่ต้องสืบคดี แถมภรรยาของผู้ต้องสงสัยยังเป็นคนรักเก่าของคุณตำรวจอีกด้วย

นับเป็นงานแนวถนัดของผู้เขียน ที่ไม่ได้สืบกันอย่างเดียว ต้องมีจุดที่ทำให้ทึ่งแถมมาให้ด้วย แม้เรื่องนี้จะเริ่มเรื่องมาเนือย ๆ แต่ก็ยังกระตุ้นความสนใจด้วย keyword สองสามคำอยู่เป็นระยะ ทำให้เราอยากรู้ว่าแต่ละคำมันเชื่อมโยงกันอย่างไร

นิยายสืบสวนสอบสวนสัญชาติญี่ปุ่น ซีรีย์นายตำรวจสุดเทพ “คางะ” เล่มนี้เป็น pageturner โดยแท้

เปิดเรื่องด้วยความตายของหญิงสาวผู้ไม่สมหวังจากรักสามเศร้า เมื่อชายคนรักของเธอและเพื่อนสนิทหักหลัง ทำลายความไว้เนื้อเชื่อใจ เธอจึงตัดสินใจที่จะ “ตาย” เมื่อพี่ชายที่เป็นตำรวจมาถึงที่เกิดเหตุ พบว่าน้องสาวตายไปแล้ว แต่มันปริศนามันอยู่ที่ว่ามันเป็น “การฆ่าตัวตาย” หรือ “การฆาตกรรม”

ความเจ๋งมันอยู่ตรงนี้ Keigo วาง plot ให้พี่ชายของหญิงสาวปิดบังข้อมูลบางอย่างที่ได้มาในฐานะคนที่เข้าถึง scene คนแรก เพื่อที่จะตะลุยสืบหาให้ได้ว่าน้องสาวฆ่าตัวตายหรือถูกฆ่า และถ้าถูกฆ่า คนฆ่าคือใคร
แต่ตำรวจทีมสืบสวนก็ไม่ใช่นายตำรวจธรรมดาสามัญที่ไหน แต่เป็นนายตำรวจคางะผู้ซึ่งมีความเก่งเทพด้านการสังเกต ตั้งสมมติฐาน และเชื่อมโยง
กลายเป็นว่าทั้งสองเป็นคู่แข่ง ชิงไหวชิงพริบกัน จุดหมายเพื่อหาคำตอบว่าใครฆ่าเธอ

บอกเลยว่าใครที่คุ้นเคยกับงานของ Keigo จะรู้ดีว่าช่วงต้นถึงกลางหนังสือที่เนิบๆ น่ะ เป็นการปูพื้นฐานบุคลิก นิสัยใจคอ และความสัมพันธ์ของตัวละครให้คนอ่านเลือกข้างแบบกลายๆ ร่วมกับแอบวางหลักฐานต่างๆ ไว้ให้คนอ่านคาดเดาไปด้วยว่าใครคือคนร้าย

แล้วท้ายเล่มก็จะเฆี่ยนสุดกำลัง เอาหลักฐานทั้งหมดมาปู เอาสมมติฐานทั้งหมดมาเฉลย แน่นอนว่าคางะกุม “ไพ่ตาย” หลักฐานที่มาจากการสืบสวนขั้นเทพของตนเองเอาไว้โดยไม่มีใครรู้ ร่วมกับบีบคั้นด้วยดราม่าความสัมพันธ์แบบสุดฤทธิ์

เล่มนี้ Keigo ไม่ได้ build ให้คางะเด่นมากจนกลบตัวละครอื่น แต่ชูให้นายตำรวจพี่ชายผู้ตายโดดเด่นไม่แพ้กัน

สนุก เวทมนตร์ของ Keigo ทำงานได้ดีเสมอ ไม่มีทางจะเดาตอนจบได้เช่นเคย

review_3507870333,nananatte,"Jul 25, 2021","เขาเป็นตำรวจจราจรขยันขันแข็ง ชีวิตนี้เหลือน้องสาวอยู่เพียงคนเดียว เธอเข้าโตเกียวไปทำงานเกือบสิบปีแล้ว วันศุกร์ น้องสาวโทรมาหาบอกว่าเหนื่อยจัง เชื่อใจใครไม่ได้อีกแล้ว และอยากตาย

พี่ชายบอกว่า เหนื่อยนักก็กลับบ้านมาพัก
น้องก็ว่าจะกลับไป
แต่วันเสาร์เธอก็ไม่มา
วันอาทิตย์ก็ไม่มา

พี่ชายพยายามโทรหาเธอ โทรเข้าที่พักหลายครั้งแต่ก็ไม่มีคนรับสาย จนกระทั่งเช้าวันจันทร์ เขายังติดต่อน้องไม่ได้ เลยตัดสินใจโทรไปที่บริษัทของน้อง แล้วก็พบว่าเธอไม่ได้มาทำงาน

ผิดปกติแน่แล้ว
เขารีบขับรถเข้าโตเกียว พอถึงที่พักราคาถูกที่น้องเช่าอยู่ มองเห็นหนังสือพิมพ์ค้างในช่องไม่ได้เก็บมา 3 วัน เคาะประตูเรียกเท่าไรก็ไม่มีคนตอบ เขาหยิบกุญแจสำรองที่น้องเคยให้ไขเข้าไปในห้องที่มืดสนิท

ภายในเงียบ...
บนโต๊ะอาหารมีแก้วไวน์
แต่ไม่มีเสียงตอบรับของน้องสาว
เขาตรงไปเปิดประตูห้องนอน บนเตียงที่มีผ้าห่มคลุมอยู่ เขาเห็นร่างของเธอพันสายไฟระโยงระยางต่อเข้ากับนาฬิกาตั้งเวลา

เพราะทำงานอุบัติเหตุบนท้องถนนมานาน ถึงไม่ได้จับตัว เขาก็รู้แล้วว่าสีผิวกับสภาพร่างของคนตายเป็นอย่างไร

...ไม่มีเวลาให้เสียตอนนี้
ชายหนุ่มรีบลุกขึ้นมาทำลายหลักฐานทั้งหมดที่มีในห้องลงใส่กระเป๋าตัวเอง ลบร่องรอยทั้งหมด แล้วจัดฉากให้ชัดว่านี่คือการฆ่าตัวตายอย่างไม่ต้องสงสัย

เมื่อเตรียมการทุกอย่างเรียบร้อย หายใจเข้าลึกๆ
เขากดโทรศัพท์แจ้งตำรวจ...

ซีรีส์คางะ ลำดับที่ 3 'ใครฆ่าเธอ'
เมื่อนายตำรวจคางะแห่งสน.เนริมะ ต้องมาปะทะตำรวจจราจรที่ขึ้นชื่อว่าเก่งกาจด้านงานหลักฐานพยานมากๆ

ภายในห้องที่ดูอย่างไรผู้หญิงคนนี้ก็ฆ่าตัวตาย คางะจะสามารถหาคนร้ายตัวจริงเจอหรือไม่ ใครเป็นคนฆ่า และเหตุจูงใจคืออะไร?

ตัวละครเรื่องนี้มีน้อย แต่ใช้งานคุ้มค่ามากค่ะ
ตอนจบไม่ใจร้ายกับคนอ่านเท่า 'ตายวันแต่ง' (จากซีรีส์ชุดเดียวกัน) คุณเคโงะใบ้มาเยอะอยู่

'ใครฆ่าเธอ'ไม่มีวิทยาศาสตร์ยากๆ เรื่องราวมาเนื้อๆ เน้นๆ ตรงไปตรงมา แต่พลิกแล้วพลิกอีก ซ่อนแล้วหลบอีก อ่านแล้วก็แบบ... โอยยยย อะไรกันเนียะะะะ

ประทับใจคุณคางะมากๆ แกเจ๋งจริงๆ
ตอนแรกสงสารคุณคางะมากเลย เพราะพี่ชายจราจรแกเล่นเก็บหลักฐานเสียจนไม่เหลืออะไรไว้ให้สืบ แล้วแบบนี้จะให้ตำรวจทำงานยังไงล่ะนั่น?

ตื่นเต้น เร้าใจ เปิดหน้าต่อไปพลิกไม่หยุด รู้สึกไว้ใจไม่ได้เลยกับคำพูดและการกระทำของแต่ละคน

อ่านสบายๆ ไม่ทำร้ายจิตใจ สนุกค่ะ :-)

Mình không biết nói sao nữa... mình hơi ngạc nhiên khi là có rất nhiều người thích quyển này... Câu chuyện vốn chỉ có hai nghi phạm chính: bạn trai cũ và bạn thân của nạn nhân. Người điều tra trực tiếp là anh trai cảnh sát của nạn nhân, sự xuất hiện của Kaga chỉ một phần để gợi ý cho người anh trai.

Mình đọc xong quyển này rất nhanh. Câu chuyện khai thác tình anh em mãnh liệt, trình bày thủ thuật nghe có vẻ thú vị. Nhưng bằng cách nào đó khoảng 50% mình không còn hứng thú với cuốn sách nữa và mình cảm thấy hơi khó chịu về người anh trai.


Và điều khiến cho cuốn sách này đặc biệt đó là cái kết, cái kết không tiết lộ hung thủ :)) và người đọc phải tự dựa theo manh mối mà đoán. Yep! Nghe rất sáng tạo, nhưng mình cảm thấy mệt mỏi với điều đó, mình tự hỏi là tại sao mình phải tự tìm ra lời giải, trong khi mình đã chẳng còn muốn biết hung thủ là ai? Kể cả diễn biến cũng chẳng thú vị để mình tập trung. Có lẽ ai đó thích bàn luận, buddy read, Bookclub sẽ thích, còn mình thì không!

review_3634142696,Woradorn,"Nov 08, 2020","** spoiler alert ** เป็นครั้งแรกที่ได้อ่านงานของ เคโงะ ที่เป็นแนวสืบสวนจริงจัง มีเรื่องราวของความเป็นมนุษย์อยู่ในนั้น การสืบสวนที่ชิงไหวชิงพริบกันระหว่าง นักสืบจราจร ยาซุมาสะ(พี่ชายของผู้ตาย) และนักสืบฆาตรกรรม คางะ
.
ฆาตรกรรม หรือ ฆ่าตัวตาย ในช่วงแรก เคโงะ ทำให้เราปักใจเชื่อว่ายังไงก็เป็นฆาตรกรรมแน่นอนโดยการเล่าเรื่องผ่าน ยาซุมาสะ แต่ในช่วงท้ายเรื่องที่พี่ชายของผู้ตายนำผู้ต้องสงสัยสองคนที่เป็นเพื่อนรักและคนรักเก่าของผู้ตายคือ คาโยโกะ และ จุนอิจิ มาสอบสวนก็ก่อให้เกิดความสับสนว่า เป็นการฆ่าตัวตายหรือเป็นฆาตรกรรม แล้วหากเป็นฆาตรกรรมใครกันที่เป็นฆาตรกร
.
แต่นักสืบ คางะ กลับมั่นใจว่าเป็นการฆาตรกรรมจริงและมีผู้ร้ายอย่างแน่นอน จึงตัดเรื่องการฆ่าตัวตายทิ้งไป ทำให้ต้องกลับไปคิดถึงประเด็นและหลักฐานต่างๆ ที่ผู้เขียนทิ้งไว้ ประเด็นที่น่าสนใจคือการให้ผู้ตายเป็นพวกถนัดซ้ายและลักษณะการฉีกซองของยานอนหลับ ซึ่งยานอนหลับที่อยู่ในที่หลังเกิดเหตุนั้นมีสองซอง
.
ยานอนหลับซองแรกถูกฉีกโดย จุนอิจิ ซึ่งแน่ใจได้ว่าเป็นคนถนัดขวาเนื่องจาก ในครั้งที่สองที่พี่ชายผู้ตายปลอมตัวเป็นตำรวจสืบสวนไปหา จุนอิจิ เพื่อสืบหาข้อมูลนั้น จุนอิจิ เป็นฝ่ายร้องขอตราตำรวจโดยยื่นมือขวาออกมา ซึ่งนี่บ่งบอกถึงลักษณะนิสัยปกติของคนถนัดขวา ดังนั้นลักษณะการฉีกของซองแรกจึงเป็นของคนถนัดขวา
.
ยานอนหลับซองที่สอง เป็นหลักฐานที่จะบอกว่าใครคือฆาตรกร ซึ่งในเรื่องนั้นไม่ได้บอกไว้ชัดเจนว่าถูกฉีกโดยใครและลักษณะการฉีกเป็นยังไง แต่การที่ คางะ มั่นใจว่านี่เป็นการฆาตรกรรมจริง ยานอนหลับซองนี้จึงต้องถูกฉีกโดยคนถนัดขวา เพราะหากถูกฉีกโดยคนถนัดซ้ายก็จะยังคงเหลือประเด็นการฆ่าตัวตายอยู่ ดังนั้นลักษณะการฉีกของซองที่สองจึงเป็นของคนถนัดขวาเช่นกัน
.
หลักฐานชิ้นสุดท้ายคือต้องหาว่า คาโยโกะ ถนัดข้างไหน สิ่งที่บ่งบอกได้คือลักษณะการฉีกซองยานอนหลับ โดยยานอนหลับซองนี้พี่ชายของผู้ตายเป็นผู้บังคับให้ คาโยโกะ เป็นคนฉีกซองใหม่เพื่อละลายดื่มเองและซองนั้นถูกทิ้งไว้ในถังขยะลายดอกกุหลาบ แต่ไม่ทันที่พี่ชายของผู้ตายได้เปิดดูก็โดน คางะ ชิงเก็บไปเสียก่อน
.
แต่สิ่งที่พี่ชายผู้ตายพูดออกมาคือเขาไม่ต้องการหลักฐานแล้วเพราะเห็นมันกับตา(หมายถึงลักษณะการฉีกซองของ คาโยโกะ) จึงทำให้มั่นใจและกดสวิทช์ปิดคดี จุดนี้จึงนำไปสู่ข้อสันนิษฐานของตัวผู้อ่านเองว่า คาโยโกะ นั้นต้องเป็นคนถนัดซ้ายอย่างแน่นอนเพราะหาก คายาโยโกะ เป็นคนถนัดขวานั้นจะทำให้ยังคงเหลือผู้ต้องสงสัยอยู่ทั้งสองคนและจะยังไม่ได้ข้อสรุป ดังนั้นคนถนัดขวานั่นแหละคือฆาตรกร
.
ทิ้งท้ายในอีกแง่หนึ่ง พี่ชายผู้ตายอาจจะยังไม่แน่ใจเลยว่าใครคือฆาตรกรจนกระทั่งวินาทีสุดท้ายที่กดสวิทช์ และใครที่เป็นคนกรีดร้องนั่นแหละคือฆาตรกร ก็สุดจะคาดเดา

review_3531203574,ปร,"Sep 04, 2020","ห้าสิบหน้าสุดท้ายให้อารมณ์เหมือนนั่งรถไฟเหาะ ลึกลับ หวาดเสียว และหักมุม!

‘ใครฆ่าเธอ’ เป็นหนึ่งในซีรีส์ของนายตำรวจคางะ เรื่องย่อ ๆ หญิงสาวผู้บอบช้ำจากการโดนหักหลังได้ถูกพบเป็น ‘ศพ’ ในห้องพักของตัวเอง ดูเหมือนว่ามันจะเป็นการฆ่าตัวตาย ทว่า พี่ชายของเธอไม่เชื่อ แล้วเขาจะลงมือสืบเรื่องนี้ด้วยตัวเอง

ความสนุกของเล่มนี้คือการได้เห็นการปะทะกันระหว่าง ‘นักสืบมือสมัครเล่น’ กับ ‘นักสืบตัวจริง’ ซึ่งมันเป็นอะไรที่สุดแสนจะบันเทิง ต่างฝ่ายต่างหักเล่ห์ชิงเหลี่ยม ไอ้ตัวนี้ก็เก่ง อีกตัวก็โคตรเก่ง โอ๊ย...มันพะยะครับ

ผมชอบตรงที่เฮียโงะ (คนเขียน) สามารถรักษาสมดุลระหว่าง ‘การสืบสวน’ กับ ‘การหักเหลี่ยม’ ได้ดี (มาก) นิยายเรื่องนี้แทบจะไม่หลุดแกนหลักเลย มันยังเป็นนิยายสืบสวนแบบ 100% ที่ใช้การหักเหลี่ยมกันของตัวละครเข้ามาเพิ่มสีสัน

อย่างที่บอกไปข้างต้นว่าช่วงท้าย (ราว ๆ 50 หน้า) เป็นอะไรที่ลุ้นระทึกมาก ตอนที่อ่านนิ้วเท้าของผมครูดไปมากับพื้น นั่งท่าหลังตรง ดวงตาแข็งโป๊กเหมือนซัดเอสเปรสโซ่ทั้งแกลลอน (คล้าย ๆ ตอนเสือกดราม่าของดาราที่เลิกกัน)

ส่วนเรื่องข้อเสีย เอาตรง ๆ นะ... “ผมหาแทบไม่เจอ”

คือจะมีชัด ๆ ก็ความเนือยช่วงกลางเรื่อง (ซึ่งถ้าเทียบกับเล่มอื่นของเฮียโงะถือว่าเล็กน้อยมาก) นอกจากนั้นก็อาจจะมีเรื่องที่เฮียไม่ได้แฝงประเด็นสะท้อนสังคมเหมือนเล่มอื่น นี่เป็นแค่นิยายมัน ๆ อ่านเอาสนุก ซึ่งคนที่อ่านนิยายสืบสวน (แบบผม) ก็ไม่ได้หวังตรงนั้นอยู่แล้ว

อ๋อ ยังมีอีกจุดหนึ่งที่ ‘บทสรุป’ ในเล่มนี้ค่อนข้าง ‘เหนือ’ ผมเชื่อว่ามีหลายคนอ่านแล้วไม่น่าจะชอบ หรือก็ไม่รู้ว่าควรจะรู้สึกอย่างไรกับบทสรุปแบบนี้ดี แต่สำหรับผมถือว่า ‘รับได้’ คือไม่ถึงกับเกลียด แต่ก็ไม่ได้ชอบเป็นพิเศษ

ผมขอสรุปว่า ‘ใครฆ่าเธอ’เป็นนิยายสืบสวนที่สนุกมาก (มาก) แม้จะไม่ได้แฝงประเด็นสะท้อนสังคมเหมือนเล่มอื่น แต่ก็ทดแทนด้วยการดำเนินเรื่องที่สนุกตื่นเต้น ช่วงท้ายเต็มไปด้วยความระทึก ไม่สามารถหยุดเสือก เอ๊ย! หยุดอ่านได้ง่าย ๆ

ที่ไม่ได้ให้เต็มเพราะตัวคดีมันไม่ได้ซับซ้อนเท่าที่มโนไว้
แต่สไตล์การดำเนินเนื้อเรื่องจากมุมมองแปลกๆ แบบนี้ก็สมเป็นเคโงะดีค่ะ

！！สปอยคนร้าย！！
สำหรับผู้ที่แอบเคืองว่าทำไมตอนท้ายไม่ได้เฉลยว่าคนร้ายคือใคร
เท่าที่เราไปอ่านสปอยของญี่ปุ่นมา เขาบอกว่าอันที่จริงมันมี 2 เวอร์ชั่น
ฉบับของปี 1996 จะมีการเขียนระบุว่าคาโยโกะฉีกซองยานอนหลับด้วยมือซ้าย
แต่พอมาเป็นฉบับปี 1999 ผู้แต่งได้ตัดข้อความนั้นออกไป
มันจึงกลายเป็นตอนจบปลายเกือบเปิดแบบที่พวกเราได้อ่านกัน
(ซึ่งความจริงมันไม่ได้เปิดนะ....)

สำหรับคนที่จำไม่ได้ หรือยังงงว่าเรื่องถนัดซ้ายขวามันยังไงเดี๋ยวจะอธิบายสั้นๆ
1. *คางะลั่นวาจาหนักแน่นว่าคดีนี้ไม่ใช่การฆ่าตัวตาย*
2. ดังนั้นซองยานอนหลับในที่เกิดเหตุต้องถูกฉีกด้วยรอยถนัดขวาเหมือนกันทั้ง 2 ซอง เพราะถ้าซองใดซองหนึ่งมีรอยฉีกแบบคนถนัดซ้าย คางะจะไม่สามารถตัดความน่าจะเป็นที่ผู้ตายฆ่าตัวตายเองออกไปได้
3. จุนอิจิเป็นคนฉีกซองแรกทำให้รู้ว่าเป็นคนถนัดขวาแน่นอน
4. คาโยโกะได้ฉีกซองยานอนหลับต่อหน้าคุณพี่ชายและทิ้งลงถังขยะ
5. *ในท้ายที่สุดคางะและพี่ชายสามารถระบุตัวคนร้ายได้* นั่นเพราะคาโยโกะฉีกแบบคนถนัดซ้าย เพราะถ้าเธอฉีกแบบคนถนัดขวาเหมือนจุนอิจิ ในสถานการณ์ตรงนั้นคางะกับคุณพี่ชายจะไม่มีทางระบุตัวคนร้ายที่แน่ชัดได้เลย
6. ดังนั้นคนร้ายตัวจริงคือ ""จุนอิจิ""


เรื่องมือข้างถนัดของคาโยโกะผู้แต่งได้ลวงเอาไว้ในหลายๆ ฉากว่าเธอใช้มือขวา
อย่างเช่นตอนที่จับหน้า ตอนใช้มือขวาเขียนพู่กันในงานศพ และเขียนได้สวยมาก
(แต่การที่คาโยโกะเขียนได้สวยมากก็สันนิษฐานได้ว่าเธอน่าจะเคยเขียนเรียนเขียนพู่กันมาไม่น้อย
และการเขียนพู่กันที่ว่า เขาจะมีธรรมเนียมให้เขียนด้วยมือขวาเสมอ)
อย่างตอนหมุนกระจกรถเธอก็ใช้มือขวาหมุนลงมา 10 เซนอย่างหงุดหงิด
แต่เขาไม่ได้ระบุว่าพวงมาลัยอยู่ข้างไหน
(ญี่ปุ่นขับรถเลนเดียวกันกับไทย แต่รถมินิคูปเปอร์ในสมัยนั้นดูเหมือนจะมีทั้งพวงมาลัยซ้ายและขวา)

แต่ด้วยข้อมูลที่ว่า *คางะลั่นวาจาว่านี่ไม่ใช่การฆ่าตัวตาย* กับ *ในท้ายที่สุดคางะและพี่ชายสามารถระบุตัวคนร้ายได้* บวกกับคำใบ้ ""คนถนัดซ้ายเฉพาะตอนกินข้าว"" ที่โผล่มาบ่อยๆ จึงทำให้คาโยโกะต้องฉีกซองด้วยมือซ้ายแน่นอน จบปิ๊ง!",4,0 likes,27

遭閨蜜和情人背叛的園子，致電向遠在家鄉的哥哥傾訴，希望他可以理解自己心中的痛苦。說好回家的園子卻遲遲不見蹤影，哥哥下崗後趕到園子的住處，見到的只是一具冰冷的遺體。園子穿著睡衣躺在床上，胸前和後背貼著被割開的電線芯，手上還握著電線的開關，像極了自殺現場。身為交通科的警官，他從現場情況判斷園子不是自殺，而是死於他殺。憑著他是一位能從極少的物證中建立假設的專家，報警前，他小心翼翼地清理現場和帶走所有的物證，打算獨自調查妹妹的死因，為的就是能夠親手制裁殺害妹妹的兇手。

幾經波折，總算揪住了最有可能殺害園子的兩個嫌犯。他們矢口否認殺害了園子，只承認對園子動了殺機，給園子下了安眠藥後懸崖勒馬，先後離開了還在昏睡的園子。棘手的是有嫌疑的兩個人並未相互包庇，而是那個並非兇手的人似乎很信任對方，認定園子必定是自殺的。是閨蜜後來延續了男友的罪行殺害了園子? 還是男友瞞著閨蜜倒回去下的毒手? 還是自始至終園子根本就是自殺? 圍繞真相討論了那麼久，得到的答案卻怎麼也無法讓人信服。

真相只有一個。藉著加賀的表情神態和通過細節的描述，誰是真正的兇手，真相呼之欲出。東野沒有按牌理出牌、沒有點名兇手、沒有白紙黑字好比隔靴搔癢，我始終不能盡興。然而，正如死者哥哥最後說的那番話，不需要嫌犯自首，也不需要證據和證詞，只要確信自己的判斷，只要知道那兩個人其中一個是兇手，這樣的結局或許就足夠了。",4,0 likes,27

I need to re-read the thing to actually try and figure out who it was that's done it, but I must say this was a much more enjoyable read than the previous two entries of the Kaga series.

The previous two were so very sad and circumstantial, it felt like they were pushed to the brink of crime and succumbed to it. This one, on the other hand, was more a traditional setting.

It's brilliance lay in not involving too many side characters. The whole book has only 4 main characters, and two of them are members of the police force. The other two are the suspects. Easy peasy.

Except, the evidence revealed is so scattered. And the testimonials provided so contradictory.

It really feels like a traditional whodunit, except for the bit where Higashino opted to not actually reveal the name of the culprit.

Apparently there's another book in the series that follows the same kind of spiel. Can't wait to get to it.",4,0 likes,27

“Trên đời này không có gia đình bình thường nào cả. Dù nhìn có vẻ bình thường, nhưng gia đình nào cũng có một câu chuyện khó nói”.


Akio Maehara, người đàn ông sống cùng vợ, Yaeko, và người mẹ già mắc bệnh Alzheimer. Một ngày nọ, Akio và vợ phát hiện con trai của họ, Naomi, đã giết chết một bé gái. Đứng trước sự phản đối của Yaeko, ông Akio chỉ còn cách cố gắng che đậy tội ác của con trai mình.

Ngay từ đầu hung thủ đã lộ diện. Nhưng mình lại cực kỳ thích cách câu chuyện khai thác những khía cạnh trong cuộc sống gia đình và xã hội. Từ việc ""nuôi dạy con cái"", bà Yaeko luôn nuông chiều con quá mức, hay ông Akio nhu nhược và luôn lãng tránh các vấn đề đang xảy ra trong gia đình, để rồi tất cả dẫn đến bi kịch này. Việc miêu tả con người khi đối mặt với tội ác mà họ gây ra rất chi tiết.

Bên cạnh đó, câu chuyện khai thác những bất đồng giữa cha mẹ - con cái, giữa con dâu - gia đình chồng. Tác giả cài cắm những vấn đề chấp nhận tội phạm sau khi cải tạo - điều gây nên nỗi lo cho vợ chồng Maehara.
Càng đọc mình cảm thấy chạnh lòng và xót, bởi cách ông Akio và vợ đối xử với người mẹ già của họ thật nhẫn tâm. Giá như họ hiểu được, rằng biết đâu cha mẹ của họ đã từng yêu thương họ thế nào. Nên phải nói, vấn đề phụng dưỡng cha mẹ cũng là một vấn đề nhức nhối trong mỗi gia đình.



Mình vốn đã đoán được một tình tiết ở cái kết, nhưng khi đọc đến đó mình vẫn thấy rùng mình, tình yêu thương của người mẹ luôn vô bờ, bạn cũng sẽ biết tại sao lại là ""Ngón tay đỏ"".

Trong series về thanh tra Kaga Kyoichiro, mình chỉ mới đọc mỗi Malice (Ác Ý). Nhưng sau khi đọc tập này mình chính thức ""lọt hố"" thanh tra Kaga. Cách Kaga điều tra và ứng xử khi phá án nó tinh tế thật sự. Trong tập này còn cho biết về mối quan hệ ""lạnh nhạt"" giữa Kaga và người cha của anh ta, nó cũng khá là buồn. Nhìn chung đây là một cuốn sách dễ đọc, nhiều cảm xúc. Không cần những cú twist hay tình tiết khó đoán, thông qua những phân tích tâm lý nó mang đến rất nhiều ý nghĩa.

หายใจไม่ทั่วท้อง เป็นอาการปกติขณะอ่าน 'นิ้วสีแดง' ค่ะ ยิ่งอ่านยิ่งลำบากใจมากขึ้นทุกที คอยเฝ้ามองตัวละครในเรื่องว่าจะตกต่ำลงๆๆ ไปจนถึงจุดไหน อ่านแล้วนึกถึง 'แผนอำพราง' (Akimitsu Takagi) นึกถึง 'คำพิพากษา' (ชาติ กอบจิตติ) เหมือนกัน กับการค่อยๆ เห็นตัวละครตัวหนึ่งตกต่ำถลำลึกลงไปเรื่อยๆ

'นิ้วสีแดง' เป็นการกลับมาเล่มกับธีมถนัดของคุณเคโงะอีกครั้งค่ะ นั่นคือ ธีมครอบครัว เพียงแต่สมาชิกในครอบครัวต้นเรื่องคราวนี้ มันไม่มีตัวไหนพอจะทำใจให้ชอบลงได้เลย ให้ตายเถอะ... คือการแสดงออกหรือตรรกะของสมาชิกแค่ละคนในบ้านนี้ ยิ่งอ่านยิ่งสังเวช อ่านไปก็ยิ่งหดหู่ใจ ทำไมมันถึงเป็นไปได้ถึงเพียงนี้...

คุณป๋าเคโงะเขียนดีงามตามสไตล์แก คุณวงศ์ศิริก็แปลอ่านได้สบายๆ ค่ะ

ยิ่งคนอ่านรู้น้อยเท่าไร น่าจะยิ่งอ่านสนุกมากเท่านั้น

ระหว่างอ่านก็เลยอดไม่ได้ที่จะเกร็งรอ
ในความรู้สึกจริงๆ แล้ว เรารู้สึกหน่วงในช่วงต้นเล่มเท่านั้น

มันคือความรู้สึกโกรธตัวละคร ที่ปล่อยให้อะไรๆ มันเลยเถิดไป
เลือกหนทางเดินที่ห่างไกลจากความถูกต้องออกไปเรื่อยๆ

เราเชื่อว่า เมื่ออ่านไปไม่นาน หลายคนคงพอเดาเนื้อเรื่องได้
แต่เพราะความเป็นเคโงะแหละ
ที่ทำให้ในที่สุดเราก็ไม่สามารถเดาทั้งหมดได้อยู่ดี
แม้ว่าช่วงหลังๆ จะรู้สึกถึงแรงพยายามอยู่สักหน่อย

คะแนนมาพุ่งขึ้นเป็น 5 ดาวเอาในตอนจบ

หนึ่งในงานที่จับใจในซีรีย์ ตำรวจระดับเทพ “คางะ” ฝีมือนักเขียนมหาเทพ “เคโงะ”

หนังสือเล่มนี้เล่าถึงความเปราะบางของสังคม ความซับซ้อนของจิตใจ มโนธรรมสำนึกของปัจเจก และความรักความผูกพันในครอบครัว ได้อย่างหมดจด

เมื่อ “พ่อ” มนุษย์ซารารี่มังธรรมดา กลับบ้านมาพบศพของเด็กหญิงวัยอนุบาลในสวนหลังบ้าน “พ่อ” จะทำอย่างไร
ครอบครัวนี้มีกันอยู่สี่คน พ่อ แม่ ลูกชายวัยรุ่น และย่าความจำเสื่อม
เมื่อต้อง “ปกป้อง” คนในครอบครัว เค้าเลือกที่จะซ่อนเร้น และปิดบังความจริง
แต่ทางที่เค้าต้อง “เลือก” ไม่ใช่แค่การปิดบังความจริงธรรมดาๆ เท่านั้น แต่ยังต้องเลือกว่าใครเป็นผู้ที่ควรจะถูกปกป้อง และใครเป็นผู้ที่ควรจะต้องเสียสละ

นายตำรวจ “คางะ” เป็นเจ้าของท้องที่เกิดเหตุ จึงเข้ามาสืบหาความจริง
ใครที่คุ้นกับซีรีย์ “คางะ” คงจะคุ้นเคยกับมาดสุดเท่ การอ่านคนสุดเฉียบ ความสามารถในการสังเกตุและวิเคราะห์ที่เทพมาก และในเรื่อง “นิ้วสีแดง” ก็เช่นกัน

โรคความจำเสื่อมกลายเป็นปัญหาในสังคมสูงอายุ super-aging อย่างญี่ปุ่น เพราะครอบครัวเป็นครอบครัวเดี่ยว การดูแลผู้สูงอายุก็ยิ่งยากลำบากล้อตามกันไป
“นิ้วสีแดง” คือนิ้วที่เปื้อนลิปสติกสีแดงที่ทั้งปู่ที่ตายไปและย่าที่ความจำเสื่อมเอามาเล่นแต่งหน้าทาปาก และนิ้วสีแดงนี้เป็นเงื่อนงำที่สำคัญในการคลี่คลายคดี

ผู้เขียนขยี้มโนธรรมสำนึกอย่างแรง โดยการบีบตัวละครให้ “เลือก” ทางที่แสนโหดร้าย ในขณะเดียวกันก็เปิดเผยจิตใจให้คนอ่านรับรู้ว่าตัวละครที่เลือกทางนั้นรู้สึกอย่างไร

ปิดเรื่องคลี่คลายคดีด้วยความเทพของ “คางะ” ได้อย่างหมดจด
นอกจากนี้ ยังเล่นเรื่องดราม่าความสัมพันธ์ระหว่าง พ่อ-ลูก คางะ ได้อย่างยอดเยี่ยม

review_1828506843,Katie Gnus,"Dec 03, 2016","When I finished reading Under the Midnight Sun (in English), I was left with a feeling of awe to Higashino's writing (and I've read all the other books of his in English) so I decided to try reading a book of his in Japanese - Akai Yubi (Red Fingers). It was my first time reading a legit full length published novel in Japanese so I had to spend a lot of time looking up words and I'm sure that coloured my experience of it.

By the end I had a headache from crying over it. Even though it's genre is mystery, it was extremely heavy on character development, and although the plot was decent it really just felt like a framework to express the rather dark and depressing story of the family's failure as a family, rather than the mystery plot. The main family in this story, the Maehara's, are a dysfunctional family in the way they seem to completely lack empathy for each other and are either ignoring each other or fighting without any heart at all. They became pathetic and tragic to the point making this book extremely depressing (I can't emphasize that enough, I don't think I've ever felt so depressed after finishing a book before).

The murder as well, of an innocent girl added to the dark air of the novel. A small girl, who died for really no good reason at all. The motive was good in the way that it got at the heart of what can destroy people emotionally, but it was such an unfair death, an unjustified death. Although, that wasn't the focus the book.

Because I had to focus extra hard to read it in a language which I'm still lacking in, it was extra painful at times, I just wanted it to end. It is extremely well written, but so, so dark. The patheticness of some of the characters is frustrating and depressing.

Overall it really captured the feeling of being absolutely drowned in darkness, doubt and desperation. A really rather heavy read.

กลับมาเรื่องสภาวะสังคม ถ้ามองในอีกแง่นึง นี่อาจทำให้เราในฐานะผู้อ่านได้คิดและตระหนักได้ว่าสภาวะแบบนี้ไม่ได้ส่งผลดี และอาจส่งผลในตรงกันข้ามแทน เพราะนิยายเล่มนี้ขับเน้นผลกระทบออกมาให้เห็นชัด แล้วน่าจะทำให้ผู้อ่านได้คิดตาม (?) ได้",3,3 likes,28

ส่วนตัวเราชอบคาแรคเตอร์คุณตำรวจคางะมากกว่าศาสตราจารย์ยุกาว่า ชอบความละเอียด รอบคอบ อ่อนโยน เห็นใจคนอื่น ประทับใจตรงที่คางะมองว่าเหยื่อของคดีฆาตกรรม ไม่ได้มีแต่คนตายเพียงคนเดียว แต่รวมไปถึงครอบครัวของเหยื่อและครอบครัวฆาตกรที่ควรได้รับการเยียวยา

สำหรับเรื่องนี้คร่าวๆเป็นคดีฆาตกรรมเด็กหญิงวันแปดขวบ ฆาตกรคือเด็กชายวัย 14 ปี เรื่องนี้รู้ตัวฆาตกรแต่แรก แต่ปัญหาคือพ่อแม่พยายามปกปิดความผิดไว้โดยพยาบามโยนความผิดไปให้ย่าที่ความจำเสื่อม แม้อ้างว่าทำเพื่อลูก แต่จริงๆก็ทำเพื่อตัวเองนั่นแหละ ไม่อยากให้ตัวเองโดนประนาม ไม่อยากเห็นลูกหมดอนาคต ลุ้นอยู่ตลอดว่าคนพ่อจะคิดกลับใจเมื่อไหร่นะ การที่ตัวเองกล้าโยนความผิดให้แม่ นั่นหมายถึงยอมสูญเสียความเป็นคนไปตลอดกาล

สุดท้ายคางะก็ไขคดีได้ในแบบของเขา ปล่อยให้ครอบครัวยอมสารภาพออกมาเอง ในที่สุดจิตใจฝ่ายดีก็เป็นฝ่ายชนะ

Pourtant les dernières pages sont une ouverture vers une réconfortante image de compréhension père/fils, improbable mais réelle et profonde.

Hay hơn nhiều so với Ác ý. Đây đúng thuần tuý một cuốn trinh thám chỉ là điều tra, đi tìm chứng cứ ngoại phạm, bới móc từ những chi tiết tưởng như vặt vãnh, nhỏ nhặt nhất. Không có hành động mang tính hồi hộp nhưng tác giả lại rất giỏi tạo được sự mong đợi ở người đọc, xây dựng dần dần những bí mật đúng như những gì người đọc mong muốn. Mỗi phát hiện của thanh tra Kaga lại mở ra một góc nhìn mới, một bí ẩn mới về nạn nhân, về nghi phạm, để cuối cùng lật tẩy một vụ án rõ ràng là rất đơn giản mà thực tế lại phức tạp vô cùng.

Mình có hơi chút thất vọng về đoạn suy đoán thủ phạm và tiết lộ ra thủ phạm vì mình không thích thủ phạm này cho lắm, nếu là một nhân vật khác thì mình sẽ thấy hay hơn.

Cuốn truyện khai thác vào chủ đề tội lỗi, sự day dứt của lương tâm và cái giá phải trả khi cố gắng che giấu tội lỗi của mình.

review_4152437632,À ngơ lơ mơ,"Aug 03, 2021","Có vẻ năm nay fan của tác giả Higashino Keigo có một mùa vụ bội thu, khi liên tiếp từ đầu năm đến giờ đã có 3 cuốn sách của bác được xuất bản ở Việt Nam rồi. Trong đó có 2 cuốn do Nhã Nam phát hành, còn cuốn “Cánh kỳ lân"" là của IPM.

Một lần nữa, tác giả lại cho chúng ta gặp lại thanh tra Kaga- nhân vật mẫn cán đã từng xuất hiện trong tác phẩm “Ác ý"". Câu chuyện lần này bắt đầu khi cảnh sát phát hiện ra một người đàn ông bị đâm trọng thương tại cây cầu Nihonbashi nổi tiếng ở Tokyo. Dù đã được đưa đi cấp cứu ngay lập tức nhưng các bác sĩ đã không thể cứu được người đàn ông xấu số. Cũng ngay trong đêm đó, cảnh sát đã bắt được nghi phạm nhưng trong quá trình chạy trốn hắn lại bị tai nạn giao thông rồi cũng qua đời. Mọi chứng cứ đều chỉ về hướng nghi phạm và các lãnh đạo cũng rất nóng lòng muốn kết thúc vụ án giết người cướp của này.

Thế nhưng, Kaga, bằng óc quan sát nhạy bén, khả năng suy luận tài tình cũng như quyết tâm tìm ra chân tướng sự việc của mình đã quyết định điều tra độc lập. Ta sẽ lại thấy quá trình anh tìm ra lời giải cho từng hành động của cả nạn nhân và hung thủ, ráp nối xâu chuỗi lại những dữ kiện rồi đưa ra suy luận và chứng minh những suy luận ấy như thế nào.

Có thể thấy Keigo dành rất nhiều tâm huyết để cố gắng xây dựng nhân vật và tạo nên những câu chuyện ẩn sau những nhân vật ấy. Ông luôn cố gắng truyền tải một thông điệp, một vấn đề còn tồn đọng trong xã hội Nhật Bản thông qua những câu chuyện của mình. Tuy lần này vấn đề không mới và bản thân vụ án cũng như câu chuyện đằng sau không có quá nhiều điểm bất ngờ hay đặc biệt, nhưng vẫn phải ghi nhận sự cố gắng của tác giả. Từ bầu không khí, cách kể chuyện, diễn biến phá án, mọi thứ tuy vẫn ở tốc độ vừa phải nhưng vẫn đủ lôi cuốn độc giả lật tiếp những trang sau.

Một tác phẩm trinh thám mình đánh giá ở mức độ vừa phải, không quá xuất sắc cũng không máu me, rùng rợn, kinh dị. Ai mới bắt đầu đọc trinh thám có thể bắt đầu từ cuốn này cũng rất oke. Mọi thứ đều dễ chịu.

review_4364023525,Nguyet Minh,"Dec 01, 2021","Cầu Nihonbashi chính là cột mốc số 0 quốc gia. “Tóm lại, từ đây người ta sẽ tung bay đi khắp nước Nhật. Chính vì lẽ đó, kỳ lân mới được gắn thêm đôi cánh.” Có lẽ, chỉ có đoạn văn ngắn này mới nhắc đôi chút về chi tiết làm nên tiêu đề quyển sách. Độc giả có thể sẽ thắc mắc rằng tại sao “cánh kỳ lân” lại được dùng để trở thành mấu chốt của vụ án? Mặc dù đọc gần hết sách cũng không thấy cánh kỳ lân làm nhiệm vụ gì, sự tò mò cũng không quá thỏa đáng. Ý đồ của Keigo về bức tượng kỳ lân bên cầu Nihonbashi chẳng qua được giải quyết bởi một nickname . Người đàn ông trung niên Takeaki với nhát dao cắm sâu vào ngực nhưng vẫn cố gắng sức lê đến bức tượng kỳ lân bên cầu. Ta sẽ hiểu ngầm là Takeaki đang muốn cầu cứu hoặc để lại thông điệp nào đó. Nhưng không kịp để giữ lại tính mạng.

Sách đủ dài để lột tả một số yếu tố văn hoá, địa danh nổi tiếng, sự chật vật kiếm tiền của người Nhật, thói sợ trách nhiệm với pháp luật hoặc với những người xung quanh. Thật khó để tìm việc hoặc được làm việc với môi trường yêu thích của lớp trẻ. Điều ấy đẩy họ đến những hành động sai lầm, có người dằn vặt và muốn được chuộc tội, nhưng cũng có kẻ hèn nhát và luôn phải sống trốn tránh sau khi gây tội.

Hầu hết các nhân vật trong truyện đều phải loay hoay đối phó vấn đề của chính họ, thậm chí sống thay trách nhiệm mà người khác gây ra. Qua đó ta thấy sự gắn kết tình cảm trong gia đình và những người yêu thương nhau dù việc hiểu lầm nhau là điều không tránh khỏi. Chàng cảnh sát trẻ Kaga hay cô gái Kaori đều đại diện cho lớp người không bao giờ từ bỏ niềm tin vào trực giác của bản thân. Kaga thì nổi tiếng là quái kiệt trong giới cảnh sát hình sự, có khả năng xử lý công việc cực kỳ nhanh nhạy, kiên trì đeo bám vụ án đến cùng. Kaori thì trân trọng kỷ niệm và luôn tự tin với việc bảo vệ thanh danh cho người mình yêu, cậu bé Yotu cũng vậy, dù tuổi trẻ nhưng luôn suy nghĩ chín chắn và biết cách an ủi người khác.

Vụ án không đặc biệt, không hề có chi tiết giật gân, giọng kể đều đều nhưng không đến nỗi dài dòng gây khó chịu. Keigo luôn hướng đến những nhân vật là giới trẻ với những biến đổi tâm lý trong quá trình trưởng thành với cái tôi, sự tự ái và tâm lý sợ gánh vác trách nhiệm. Diễn biến và thông điệp ở đây khá giống với cuốn “Chuộc tội” của Minato Kanae.",3,,29

Câu chuyện này xảy đến với nhóm thiếu niên làm bạn cùng câu lạc bộ bơi bị chết đuối. Từ việc vô ý rồi dần trở thành cố tình che giấu, thậm chí phạm tội giết người thật sự. Motif này không mới nhưng là bài học không bao giờ cũ. Và tình thương của gia đình là nơi đủ lớn để xoá đi sự sợ hãi ám ảnh đó.

Dù vậy, bất cứ quyết định nào, cho dù là tình thương, cũng có cái giá phải trả, đôi khi quá muộn để kéo lại những mạng sống. Điều ta có thể làm chỉ có thể là cố gắng đừng để bản thân bị cuốn đi bởi sự đen tối của ganh tỵ và sân si, mà nếu phạm phải, nên chấp nhận sửa ngay lúc ấy; trước khi mọi việc đi quá xa đến mức ta không còn kiểm soát nổi.

Đôi chỗ hơi loãng không khí trong truyện vì tác giả muốn nối tiếp câu chuyện về nhân vật điều tra viên Kaga vốn đã xuất hiện ở quyển “Ác ý”. Và tính cách nhân vật này vẫn chưa hẳn nổi bật. Vì vậy, mình cho 3/5.",3,,29

เป็นหนังสือสืบสวนสอบสวนที่ทิ้งประโยค “เรื่องนี้สอนให้รู้ว่า...” เอาไว้ในหัวใจและสมอง

มันเป็นการสืบสวนคดีฆาตกรรมที่จบได้ซึ้งกินใจ

เปิดเรื่องด้วยความตายของชายผู้เป็นพ่อถูกมีดปักกลางอก แต่ซมซานไปทิ้ง dying message ไว้ใต้ปีกรูปปั้นกิเลน
ผู้ต้องสงสัยในคดี ก็ดันมามีอันเป็นไปซะอีก
เบาะแสที่ตำรวจสุด cool อย่าง “คางะ” ใช้ในการคนหาคำตอบคือใบเสร็จร้านโซบะ!

หนังสือเล่มนี้เป็นหนังสือในซีรีย์ตำรวจสุด cool “คางะ”
ปูเรื่องด้วยการตายที่ไม่สมเหตุสมผล ผู้ต้องสงสัยที่แก้ต่างให้ตัวเองไม่ได้ และดราม่าครอบครัวที่บีบคั้นอารมณ์
แน่นอนว่าตามสไตล์เราจะได้อ่านหนังสือที่ดำเนินอย่างเนิบๆ นุ่มๆ ไปจนถึงกลางเล่ม แล้วก็เริ่มปล่อยของตอนกลางเล่ม และเคี่ยนอัตราการเต้นของหัวใจคนอ่านท้ายเล่ม

คนอ่านจะถูกทำให้ไขว้เขวว่าจริงๆ แล้วเป็นการฆาตกรรมชิงทรัพย์ดาดๆ หรือเป็นฆาตกรรมที่บรรจุความแค้นเอาไว้เต็มเปี่ยมของลูกจ้างที่มีต่อนายจ้าง
หรือแท้จริงแล้ว อุบัติเหตุของชมรมว่ายน้ำมัธยมต้นของลูกชายผู้ตาย มีส่วนเกี่ยวข้องกับการฆาตกรรมผู้เป็นพ่อกันแน่
แต่ละช่วงที่อ่านมันจะมีความสงสัยต่างๆ กันไป
และในที่สุดก็ได้รับคำเฉลยแบบคาดไม่ถึงท้ายเล่ม

สะพานนิฮอมบาชิ เป็นหลักกิโลเมตรที่ศูนย์ ที่ใช้สำหรับวัดระยะทางไปจังหวัดต่างๆ ทั่วญี่ปุ่น
เป็นทั้งจุดเริ่มต้นของตัวละครที่เดินทางจากต่างจังหวัดเข้ามาสู่โตเกียว และก็เป็นจุดเดียวกันที่เกิดเหตุฆาตกรรมในเรื่องนี้
Keigo เอาพื้นที่บริเวณนี้มาเดินเรื่องจนอยากเก็บกระเป๋า บินไปตามรอยที่ญี่ปุ่นเลยทีเดียว (แต่ตอนนี้เปิด google street view ดูแก้ขัดไปก่อน)

นอกจากการถ่ายทอดความรักของพ่อออกมาได้อย่างละเอียดอ่อนแล้ว ยังชอบตรงที่ Keigo ทำให้เห็นเกียรติศักดิ์ศรีของการรับผิดชอบในการกระทำ ไม่ใช่ซุกความผิด วิ่งหนีความจริงไปตลอด แถมยังถ่ายทอดด้วยการเล่าผ่านนิยายได้อย่างยอดเยี่ยม

Đây cũng là nơi xảy ra vụ án chính của tập truyện này. Một người đàn ông bị dao đâm vào ngực, cố gắng đi đến tượng kỳ lân ở cầu Nihonbashi mà không ghé qua đồn cảnh sát để báo án, ông ta dốc hết sức mình như thế mà đến bên tượng kỳ lân để làm gì? Câu hỏi sẽ được giải đáp ở những trang cuối của tác phẩm.

Vụ án diễn ra khi nạn nhân đã chết, không có nhân chứng, hung thủ trong khi bị cảnh sát đuổi bắt thì bị xe tải tông, dẫn đến hôn mê rồi sau đó mất mạng. Mọi đầu mối để giải quyết dường như đều bị chặn đứng. Chúng ta sẽ đồng hành cũng thanh tra Kaga để tìm hiểu vụ án này, ẩn khuất sau vụ án ""bề nổi"" này là một vụ ""chìm không đáng có"" - bạn đọc xong vụ này rồi sẽ biết mình đang chơi chữ một chút :v

Đánh giá của mình thì vụ này tình tiết chậm, hơn nữa là cũng giống như quyển Phương Trình Hạ Chí - đoạn đầu thật sự mình đọc rất ngán, bởi có quá nhiều tên riêng, một số ông cảnh sát ở đâu thêm vào rồi cả tên địa danh nữa, do đó tuy quyển này mỏng nhưng những trang đầu mình nuốt không trôi.

Theo mình đã đọc Tử Kim Trần, thanh tra Kaga khá giống thanh tra Cao Đông ở chỗ không chấp nhận bỏ qua những khe hở trong khi phá án, bởi chính những tình tiết đó mới gợi nên nhiều sự việc để giải quyết vụ án không nhân chứng ở đầu truyện. Bên cạnh đó, bác Keigo đã tài tình móc nối nhiều chi tiết từ quá khứ cho đến hiện tại để hoàn thiện nên Cánh Kỳ Lân. Bìa truyện cũng là một điểm cộng: Bên cạnh bức tượng kỳ lân còn có những chú hạc giấy, bạn đọc truyện sẽ thấy chi tiết hạc giấy ý nghĩa và gây xúc động như thế nào...

Có điểm này mình không thích trong truyện: nạn nhân bị giết hại, cảnh sát hỏi gia đình thì ai nấy đều chưng hửng, hỏi cái gì cũng không rõ, không biết... hai đứa con thì không nói, còn bà vợ theo suy nghĩ của mình cứ như xem ông chồng là máy sản xuất tiền vậy, có thì không quan tâm, mất đi rồi thì lại thấy lo.",4,1 like,29

Hoàn cảnh của chú bé Tomoyuki và mẹ khiến mình cảm thấy thật ngậm ngùi, y như câu chuyện của cô bé Mizuho và mẹ Kaoruko trong Ngôi nhà của người cá say ngủ.

Vụ án người đàn ông bị đâm vào ngực và chết trên cầu Nihonbashi tưởng chừng là một vụ án đơn giản, khi ngay lập tức cảnh sát bắt được kẻ tình nghi dù ngay sau đó hắn gặp tai nạn và chết. Cảnh sát đã dự định khép lại cuộc điều tra, gán tội danh giết người cho một người đã chết, nhưng nhờ sự ""lì lợm"" của thanh tra Kaga mà chân tướng sự việc được đưa ra ánh sáng, gột sạch tiếng oan cho cả nạn nhân cũng như kẻ tình nghi xấu số.

Câu chuyện khép lại bằng việc Yuto cùng người bạn của mình quyết tâm đối mặt với quá khứ, sửa chữa những sai lầm trước kia. Dẫu rằng điều này có thể ảnh hưởng đến tương lai của các bạn trẻ, nhưng còn hơn là phải sống trong dằn vặt cả cuộc đời.

Yuto mang máng hiểu ra bố đã nghĩ gì khi cố gắng đi về phía cầu Nihonbashi dù đang trong tình trạng nguy ngập. Bố muốn nhắn nhủ con trai, ""Dũng cảm lên, đừng lẩn trốn sự thật, hãy làm những điều mình tin là đúng.""

I have this strange feeling that out of four-keigo-already-published-novels by IPM, two have shared the same slow-burn vibe, all started by a murder then spreading to the effect of it on everyone around (?) and ironically, these two has the same packaging color, too.

This one isn’t bad, but it surely couldn’t replace the position that Journey Under the Midnight Sun or Naoko; at this point, there’s unlikely anything could top these two novels in my list either ( yeah, I know my comparison seems to be unsettling since these books aren’t placed in the same genre category but still…)

(view spoiler)



Speaking again of this book, nothing is shocking here, no mind-blowing ending, no bewildered twists, and I think the ending is handled quite alright. Though it’s not the type of book I would find myself dig reading over and over, it’s still worth reading and recommended at some points.",3,1 like,29

Kirin dường như là ý nghĩa bao chùm tác phẩm ( ước muốn dang rộng đôi cánh bay xa ) tuy nhiên mình đọc xong thì chưa thấy rõ sự tương quan giữa câu chuyện và tầng ý nghĩa đó. Hơn nữa hình ảnh Kirin xuất hiện chỉ khoảnh 3-4 lần.
Mặt tối khác của xã hội được Keigo đưa ra: cách chúng ta nuôi dạy trẻ nhỏ có ảnh hưởng thế nào đến tương lai sau này? Đây cũng là một thực trạng khá gắt bên Nhật lúc bấy giờ.

What is uni？
Uni is a place that turned me to a person who relies on detective novels to relax (well I deliberately avoid the word criminal)
书腰上说这是东野圭吾也认为的加贺恭一郎系列最出色的一本，我没看过其他的，所以难说这是不是为了商业宣传。东野圭吾笔下两个系列：加贺恭一郎，汤川学（神探伽利略）。一个是刑警，一个是物理学教授。由于后者是《嫌疑人X献身》的人物，由福山雅治主演过电影版，作品本身也获得直木奖，故而理所应当地更出名些。两个人物迥然不同，如果情节上伽利略系列因为有嫌疑人x而更加出色的话，加贺这个人物却似乎更讨喜。作为物理学家的汤川很适合本格推理，其本身的智商和逻辑就与那些反社会的本格犯罪者一样精妙，故而是一场等量的对决。
而加贺作为刑警（官至警部补），也是精英体系里的一员。从警察破案的角度来讲，要不断回到现场，还原受害人行踪，走访目击者，因此加贺系列就成了社会推理的驻足地。
不由得感叹东野圭吾真是会圈钱啊！
我喜欢加贺的原因是他虽也是精英，但主要是靠敏锐性而非纯智商调查的。并且有着不厌其烦地“白跑”精神，白跑的路多了，离真相才会更近。性格上虽然也反感官僚体制的束缚所以宁可留在地方，但也不至于生生带刺。有过不去的坎，比如说和父亲的关系，但也会温和待人。
至于本书，东野明显很老到了，自己一条线，受害人儿子一条线，嫌疑人一条线，最后还是靠着亲情领悟到了受害人的death message 看的过程中有某种程度“套路感”。但东野的高人之处就在于，即使有套路的痕迹，我最终也没能找出其中的套路，才出凶手是谁。当然很有可能是东野深谙读者喜欢看悬疑推理小说猜凶手的习惯，故而故意找了一个极其不起眼的人物，不起眼到只有一句对话（还是邮件回复），所以我也觉得有些牵强。（最重要的是似乎没有直接证据，而是通过发觉背后几年前的隐情，让凶手崩溃最后抓获然后他自己承认的，即使作为社会派的推理小说，这个能也过于社会了一点😂）",4,0 likes,29

review_4425781101,Ges,"Dec 30, 2021","Cánh kỳ lân là cuốn truyện tôi thích nhất trong số 3 cuốn mới ra của Keigo, nhưng tôi thích cuốn sách này không phải vì yếu tố trinh thám – dù rằng quá trình điều tra của thanh tra Kaga khá là “ảo ma Canada” và có thể khiến các fan thể loại trinh thám suy luận yêu thích. Tôi thích câu chuyện này vì những vấn đề râu ria bên ngoài, điều mà tôi cho rằng Keigo muốn truyền đạt về đất nước ông đang sống – những điều được nhìn ở góc nhìn khác, cảm nhận khác so với những người “không sống ở Nhật” và chỉ “nghe nói về nước Nhật” – những điều đó được thể hiện thông qua 1 cuốn tiểu thuyết trinh thám thông thường. Những điều đó là gì?
- Đầu tiên, đó là vấn đề về giáo dục! Chúng ta vẫn thường khâm phục nền giáo dục Nhật Bản, một nền giáo dục dạy trẻ em biết ý thức bảo vệ môi trường, biết lễ phép cám ơn khi được nhường đường, biết kiên nhẫn xếp hàng chờ phát thực phẩm..v..v.. Chúng ta vẫn xuýt xoa khi nghe chuyện các ông bố bà mẹ Nhật cho những đứa con vài ba tuổi của họ ăn mặc phong phanh ra trời tuyết rơi để rèn luyện, hay các mẹ bỉm sữa vẫn truyền nhau những bí kíp ăn dặm kiểu Nhật, dạy con kiểu Nhật..v..v.. Thế nhưng, nền giáo dục nào cũng có vấn đề của riêng nó, và nước Nhật cũng không nằm ngoài quy luật đó. Như trong câu chuyện này đã chứng minh: sự giáo dục không đúng hướng có thể dẫn đến hậu quả đau đớn như thế nào. Và thanh tra Kaga – một người đã từng là thầy giáo, đã có lúc mất bình tĩnh đối với 1 giáo viên về phương pháp giáo dục sai trái của anh ta. Có lẽ, một trong những động lực để thanh tra Kaga đi đến cùng trong cuộc điều tra của mình xuất phát từ cái tâm của người thầy chứ không chỉ đơn thuần là quan điểm tôn thờ sự thật của 1 cảnh sát. Và từ cơ sở sự sai lệch trong giáo dục, có thể dẫn đến vấn đề thứ hai sau đây:
- Đó là chuyện bất công xã hội, chênh lệch giàu nghèo, điều kiện làm việc tồi tệ và mất an toàn cho những con người ở dưới đáy xã hội, sự gian dối của giới chủ..v..v.. Chuyện mất cân bằng giàu nghèo thì là vấn đề chung của cả thế giới chứ không riêng gì Nhật Bản nên chẳng có gì lạ cả, nhưng vấn đề về an toàn lao động và sự gian dối của những người sử dụng lao động lại là điều có thể khiến nhiều người bất ngờ. Người Nhật cẩn thận, chỉn chu, tuân thủ nguyên tắc và trung thực nổi tiếng thế giới mà cũng xảy ra những vấn đề như ở những nước thế giới thứ 3 như vậy ư? Thực ra, cũng chẳng có gì khó hiểu cả, bởi nền kinh tế tư bản nào mà chả là bóc lột sức lao động, mối quan hệ giữa người sử dụng lao động và người lao động bao giờ cũng là mâu thuẫn về lợi ích, và trong câu chuyện về kinh tế thì lời mở đầu nào cũng là tối đa hóa lợi nhuận mà thôi! Cá nhân tôi là 1 người làm công tác an toàn cho 1 công ty của Nhật, tôi luôn được các chuyên gia người Nhật ca ngợi về sự tuân thủ tuyệt đối tiêu chuẩn làm việc an toàn của cả người công nhân và người sử dụng lao động ở Nhật, và họ luôn dặn dò, hướng dẫn chúng tôi phải tuyệt đối tuân thủ như người Nhật. Nhưng khi được tham quan trực tiếp, được mục sở thị điều kiện làm việc của nhà máy tại Nhật, thì tôi hiểu rằng lý thuyết và thực tế có 1 khoảng cách xa hơn khoảng cách địa lý từ Việt Nam đến Nhật Bản nữa cơ! Có chăng sự gian dối trong công tác báo cáo an toàn lao động được ươm mầm từ thói xấu nảy sinh trong quá trình giáo dục, đào tạo con người? vả chăng việc người Nhật luôn tự hào vỗ ngực về việc tuân thủ an toàn lao động của mình cũng 1 phần xuất phát từ niềm tự tôn dân tộc thái quá, cùng với sự bảo thủ chủ quan – điều có thể ảnh hưởng trực tiếp đến công cuộc phát triển kinh tế của nước Nhật – yếu tố mà tôi nhận ra, chính Keigo cũng đau đáu, và được lặp đi lặp lại trong Cánh kỳ lân
- Đó là cụm từ “Khủng hoảng kinh tế”! tôi ko đếm nên không nhớ rõ vấn đề khủng hoảng kinh tế được nhắc đến mấy lần trong truyện, nhưng chắc chắn là hơn 1 lần! Kinh tế toàn cầu khủng hoảng theo đợt, có thể kéo dài vài năm – nhưng kinh tế Nhật Bản đã khủng hoảng đến ngót nghét 20 năm nay rồi chưa thoát ra được! ngoài những nhân tố (cả khách quan và chủ quan) đã thành truyền thống như: nghèo tài nguyên, giàu thiên tai, dân số già..v..v..thì Nhật Bản cũng cần nhìn thẳng vào sự thật rằng: họ đã ngủ quên trên vinh quang quá khứ quá lâu, họ bảo thủ và chậm đổi mới trong 1 thời đại mà KHÔNG ĐỔI MỚI đồng nghĩa với CHẾT!!! Nhật Bản đã từng là cái rốn phát triển công nghệ cao của cả thế giới, nhưng giờ đây đang tụt lại và dần trở thành kẻ đứng ngoài cuộc đua về công nghệ trước sự vươn lên của Trung Quốc, Hàn Quốc, Singapore, Ấn Độ (đấy là chỉ nói riêng ở châu Á, chưa tính Israel, Đức, Scandinavia ở châu Âu hay Hoa Kỳ với cái rốn của riêng nó ở Silicon valley). Những tên tuổi như Sony, Toshiba giờ đây chìm nghỉm trước những đế chế khổng lồ như Samsung, Huawei, Tencent..v..v.. Tôi đọc được đâu đó bài viết về việc Nhật Bản quyết tâm trở lại với cuộc đua công nghệ qua Olympic Tokyo 2020, nhưng rồi đó lại là 1 show diễn công nghệ thất bại! Kết hợp lại những nhân tố truyền thống đã nhận ra từ lâu và những nhân tố truyền thống nhưng mới được chỉ ra, thật khó để nền kinh tế Nhật Bản thay đổi, nếu bản thân người Nhật không thay đổi. Và cũng chẳng có gì khó hiểu khi đến 1 nhà văn cũng phải băn khoăn, trăn trở vì kinh tế nước nhà! Nhưng trò đời thì thường “chua như là dưa ghém” nên để giải quyết bài toán kinh tế, đôi khi phải trả bằng cái giá không hề rẻ chút nào, cái giá đó sẽ được trình bày ở những dòng bên dưới đây!
- Cái giá phải trả cho việc phát triển kinh tế bất chấp, đó là sự mai một của những giá trị truyền thống và sự lộn xộn về quy hoạch – đây là điều cuối cùng tôi muốn nói đến qua cái bài viết dài ngoằng không đâu vào đâu này. Đọc Cánh kỳ lân, tôi nhận ra 1 Keigo rất khác – 1 Keigo yêu thích và vô cùng am hiểu những giá trị truyền thống. Từ truyền thống lễ thờ “Thất phúc thần” đến những nhân vật, những công trình lịch sử như Sư tăng Benkei, cầu Nihonbashi, từ nghệ thuật gấp giấy Nhật đến những hàng quán ăn uống lâu đời. Tất cả những chi tiết này (cũng như những chi tiết khác của khu Nihonbashi tôi không nhớ để liệt kê ra đây) sẽ liên tục xuất hiện trong Cánh kỳ lân. Không quá khi nói rằng 1 góc Tokyo xưa cũ, trầm mặc nhưng tinh tế được hiện lên dưới ngòi bút của Keigo – 1 tác giả chuyên viết tiểu thuyết trinh thám! Nếu như 13.67 hay Người trong lưới tôi coi như cẩm nang du lịch nếu có dịp đến HongKong, thì Cánh kỳ lân cũng sẽ là cuốn sách cẩm nang tôi mang theo hành lý nếu có dịp đến Tokyo! Và hình ảnh mang tính tượng trưng cho việc những giá trị của 1 nước Nhật truyền thống bị mai một trong thời hiện đại có lẽ chính là hình ảnh cây cầu Nihonbashi – một cây cầu có thật, thậm chí vô cùng nổi tiếng - nơi “mọi nẻo đường nước Nhật đều đổ về” (giống như cái cách người ta nói về Rome thời La Mã) – nơi có cột mốc số “0” của Nhật Bản – Nơi bắt đầu và kết thúc ước mơ Tokyo của Kaori và Fuyuki – nơi là hiện trường của vụ án – nơi có tượng kỳ lân dang cánh! (tôi đính kèm bài viết này hình ảnh cầu Nihonbashi để các bạn nào kiên nhẫn đọc đến đây khỏi mất công search gg. Cây cầu nhỏ bằng đá có kiến trúc rất đẹp và mang ý nghĩa lịch sử rất lớn lao, nhưng đồng thời cũng mang trên mình nỗi buồn về mặt trái của phát triển đô thị - nỗi buồn lơ lửng ngay phía trên cầu Nihonbashi, mà du khách đứng trên cầu chỉ cần ngẩng đầu lên là thấy).
Vĩ thanh: Bà mẹ của cậu bé kỳ lân ước mong 1 ngày nào đó cậu tỉnh lại, như kỳ lân thêm 1 lần nữa dang cánh bay lên. Và có lẽ Keigo cũng gửi gắm niềm mong mỏi của mình, mong nước Nhật (cả kinh tế và những giá trị truyền thống của Nhật Bản) sẽ lại lần nữa thức tỉnh, vươn mình và sải cánh bay!!!

Para empezar, el punto de partida es bastante interesante y nos plantea una situación repleta de incertidumbre. La ambientación posterior de un Tokio ruinoso también es destacable. Incluso la prosa, más propia de una novela juvenil, ayuda a que uno pase página tras página.

¿El problema? Pues además de su sencillez en muchos aspectos, la trama termina alargándose demasiado y sobre todo, los personajes son un peñazo. Decir que parecen hermético y robóticos sería igual exagerar, pero lo cierto es que muestran una humanidad muy escasa y además sus diálogos son demasiado forzados y sin ninguna gracia. Imposible empatizar con ellos, salvo que seas un japones asocial de estos que no salen de casa.

review_2257790107,Libros Prestados,"Jan 23, 2018","Prefiero a Higashino en thriller o novela detectivesca.

Eso no quiere decir que éste sea un mal libro, es básicamente una historia de aventuras con un trasfondo, digamos, sociológico, en cuanto habla de problemáticas sociales e interacciones humanas. Nada nuevo bajo el sol, dado que las historias postapocalípticas suelen servir para hacer un retrato de la humanidad y lo que significa ser humano. Aunque en este caso tal vez no se profundice demasiado en ello. Que no se me entienda mal, Higashino no huye de problemas serios o escabrosos como la eutanasia, el suicidio, las diferencias sociales, la vejez o el sexo. El problema es que quiere hablar de todo ello, abarca demasiado, y al final se queda en una sucesión de cuestiones que los personajes discuten o solucionan (o más bien se solucionan) como si de fases de un videojuego se tratara. No puede profundizar lo suficiente. Aunque es cierto que resulta curioso ver el punto de vista y la forma de pensar de personajes educados en la cultura japonesa. Como mujer occidental a veces me resultaba muy interesante y otras me incomodaban un poco.

Y luego está el gran momento donde la tensión llega a cierto punto y de repente el autor decide recular de manera muy obvia, dando una solución que casi parece que se hubiera inventado en el último momento. Que no creo que fuera el caso, pero el frenazo es bastante obvio.

En lo que resalta esta novela es en tener un ritmo rápido y plantear continuamente nuevos retos. Muy pocas veces habrá momentos de quietud o aburridos. Es un obstáculo tras otro sin casi dar tiempo para respirar. Son diez personas que de repente se quedan solas en un mundo que se está yendo al garete y tienen que sobrevivir sin tener mucha idea o capacidades para hacerlo.

A aquellos que nunca hayan leído a un autor japonés y les guste la ciencia ficción y/o las historias apocalípticas o postapocalípticas, les pueda interesar.

Keigo Higashino es un autor de thrillers de gran éxito en el sudeste asiático que con la presente novela, sin alejarse de la intriga, el suspense y el misterio, se embarca en una historia apocalíptica con ropaje de ciencia ficción y una buena pista en su título. La historia de un aparente fin del mundo, repleta de cuestiones filosóficas causadas por el inusual escenario y, que, aunque se nota un tanto alargada innecesariamente en algunas de las situaciones planteadas, se encuentra narrado de forma harto ágil, lo que hace muy rápida su lectura. La trama juega con la existencia inexplicada de una ciudad vacía de población —y de animales—, donde unos pocos seres humanos van a tener que sobrevivir en condiciones cada vez más extremas mientras se empeñan en tratar de entender qué les ha sucedido. Una mezcla entre la escena inicial de ""Abre los ojos"" con las catástrofes de ""2012"" o ""El día después de mañana"" circunscritas a Tokio —los protagonistas en ningún momento llegan a conocer la situación en el resto del planeta— y si tan sólo quedarán unos pocos supervivientes sobre la faz de la Tierra.

La catástrofe en este caso viene determinada por un pulso de un agujero negro que llegará a Japón el día 13 a las 13 y 13 segundos y que acabará produciendo un desplazamiento temporal que puede generar una paradoja y de ahí el titulo de la novela.

Después del incidente un grupo de gente se encuentra en un Tokyo despoblado en el cual solo quedan un montón de coches que sin conductores han chocado y creado un amasijo de hierros y chatarra que impide el movimiento.

LA novela sigue el desplazamiento a través de esta ciudad que se va degradando por momentos debido a incendios, terremotos, lluvia y sus problemas para sobrevivir.

Las conversaciones entres los personajes tienen un carácter moral, ético muchas veces, asi como criticas a la sociedad, el gobierno, la forma de organización social, como se deben organizar ellos, como decidir sus pasos. Y también intentar comprender que ha pasado y como pueden mejorar sus situación.

La novela mantiene el interés a la largo de sus páginas y es difícil de dejar de leer.",3,0 likes,31

review_3232881482,Claudia Marcela,"Mar 15, 2020","El 13 de marzo a las 13 horas y 13 minutos y 13 segundos está pronósticado que la tierra pasará cerca de un hoyo de gusano que podría afectar la vida en la tierra si sucede algo importante. Cuando un conjunto de personajes se ven arrojados a un mundo solitario tras el fenómeno, solo les queda sobrevivir mientras intentan descubrir por qué sucedió.

Tenía ganas de leer algo referente al viernes 13 que pasó, y buscando en la biblioteca me topé con este libro. Muy adecuado porque justamente habla del 13 de marzo.

La historia es aparentemente sencilla, con un grupo de personajes lanzados a una situación imposible, teniendo que lidiar con las personalidades tan diferentes, con las eventualidades que les van sucediendo a la par que todos intentan explicarse por qué están allí. Para cualquiera que disfrute leyendo literatura/viendo películas japonesas, entenderá a qué me refiero si digo que este es un libro muy cliché japonés. Con sus personajes estereotipados: la colegiala, el policía, el mafioso, los ancianos, el gordo (¡es que literalmente le llaman el gordo! como si eso fuera una personalidad), el soberbio hombre de negocios, el empleado lamebotas, el prota de buen corazón pero que toma las peores decisiones. Incluso la madre creepy que esconde algún secretillo oscuro.

Esta historia habría ganado mucho más si los diálogos no fueran tan típicos, tan de guión. De hecho, a mi parecer es una historia contada más como guión cinematográfico, con mucha descripción de cada detalle y diálogo que verdadera profundidad en la trama. Las relaciones entre los personajes se siente muy artificial y no llegamos a conocer a ninguno realmente bien como para lamentar a los que mueren (bueno, uno sí que me dolió su muerte... era el que menos se lo merecía. Mejor le hubiera tocado al prota XD).

El final es casi burlón en su extremo ilógico, (view spoiler)

Lo Mejor
Las reflexiones que se van haciendo los personajes sobre la marcha, sobre el significado de la vida, del bien y el mal y otras varias cosas.

Lo Peor
Al terminar sentí que acababa de ver una película palomera de esas que pasan los fines de semana. Sin mayor relevancia.

Citas
En una situación de vida o muerte, uno no puede confiar su destino a lo que opine el resto.

Pensaba en cómo podríamos sobrevivir todos. O, de no ser eso posible, en cómo reducir al mínimo el número de bajas. Esa era mi obsesión. Pero ahora me doy cuenta de que vivir no es solo permanecer vivo. Creo que, sea cuál sea la situación, hay que tener en cuenta la vida individual de cada uno.
—La vida…

Debido al influjo sobre la Tierra de un agujero negro, el 13 de marzo, a las 13 horas, 13 minutos y 13 segundos se producirá un fenómeno denominado P-13. Fuyuki Kuga, detective de la Jefatura de Policía de Tokio, recibe también un balazo de los delincuentes y se desmaya. Cuando recobra el conocimiento, constata que no queda nadie en las calles de Tokio. Deambulando por la ciudad, sin comprender qué está pasando, encontrará a otras diez personas que han sufrido el mismo fenómeno. Incapaces de asimilar la situación, el grupo intenta sobrevivir vagando por un Tokio en ruinas, devastado por las catástrofes naturales y las enfermedades.

Ahora el balance. A pesar de que la novela es de lectura fácil por momentos me aburrió debido a lo acartonado de sus personajes y la poco funcional relación entre los hermanos protagonistas.",2,0 likes,31

Los personajes más planos que la meseta que es Castilla, los diálogos repititivos y en algunos momentos sin sentido. El argumento tiene potencial pero era mejor centrarse en el no arco evolutivo de los personajes. Las mujeres están un poco como las flores de plástico de la abuela, alguien las trajo una vez y como no hacen feo ahí están, para qué darles identidad y fuerza si ya tenemos a los arquetipos masculinos bien definidos.

Te mantiene en vilo todo el tiempo, eso se lo concedo, y tampoco es una mala lectura (ni mucho menos está mal narrado), pero cuando llegas a su final, sin llegar a ser decepcionante, te das cuenta de que pese a un argumento tan rico y original (aunque puede que el señor King hubiera hecho algo parecido) no ha sido para tanto y que se desperdicia la idea en ciertos (bastantes) puntos.
Aun así, si te gusta la ciencia ficción y la supervivencia extrema, lo recomiendo. Como thriller psicológico no, los protagonistas me parecieron muy esclavos de sus roles en ocasiones y muy ajenos a ellos en otras, y sin algo que justificara plenamente esos cambios en no pocas ocasiones.",3,0 likes,31

Las medidas del gobierno para afrontarlo se estudian en el más absoluto secreto. Ni siquiera los científicos saben exactamente en qué consistirá dicho fenómeno y sus consecuencias: los departamentos que se ocupan del asunto se han limitado a señalar que es importante suspender por unos instantes toda actividad peligrosa, así como mantenerse alejado de los lugares de riesgo. Sin embargo, esta información se ha mantenido oculta con la idea de no alterar a la población, prohibiéndose su divulgación hasta que pase el fenómeno. Una vez que llega el momento clave, unas pocas personas dispersas por la ciudad de Tokyo, se encuentran en lo que parece un universo alternativo, en el que todos los demás habitantes han desaparecido misteriosamente. Estas personas se irán encontrando poco a poco formando un grupo que intentará primero sobrevivir, pero también regresar a su propio mundo.

Buena novela de ambiente post-apocalíptico, que si bien no tiene ningún rigor científico, mantiene la tensión y resulta bastante divertida. Una de las cuestiones que me parecieron más interesantes es la descripción del carácter de los protagonistas, que sirve para mostrar con singularidad la cultura japonesa en la actualidad.

Algo que me gustó mucho es que a pesar de manejar conceptos científicos y un fenómeno astrofísico que amenaza a la humanidad, el autor lo explica de una forma muy sencilla y se vuelve digerible la trama, no se centra tanto en la ciencia sino en cómo reaccionan las personas en situaciones catastróficas y explotando el raciocinio y los bajos instintos de los humanos.

เล่มนี้แม้จะเป็นนิยายฆาตกรรม แต่รู้สึกว่าธีมหลักจะเป็นเรื่องการนอกใจมากกว่า คุณเคโงะเขียนได้เป็นขั้นตอน เล่าความรู้สึกละเอียดซะจนนึกว่าเคยเป็นฝ่ายนอกใจซะเองยังไง ยังงั้น

เริ่มต้นจากวาตาเบะผู้ชายทั่วไป มีครอบครัว มีลูกสาวหนึ่งคน ไม่เคยคิดนอกใจ คิดว่าครอบครัวแบบนี้ก็มีความสุขดี บังเอิญได้มารู้จักกับลูกจ้างบริษัทชื่ออากิฮะ จากไม่รู้สึกอะไร ก็เริ่มตื่นเต้นในการได้เจอกัน ไปไหนมาไหนด้วยกัน แม้จะรู้สึกผิดในการกระทำ แต่ความตื่นเต้นท้าทายกลับยั่วยวนกว่า นำไปสู่ sex การโกหกครั้งแล้วครั้งเล่า ถลำลึกลงไปเรื่อยๆ แม้ใครจะห้ามทัดทานก็หยุดไม่อยู่ จนเกือบนำไปสู่จุดที่ไม่อาจย้อนกลับ
แต่ตัวอากิฮะเองกลับมีความลับบางอย่างปิดบังไว้ คดีฆาตกรรมที่เธอเกี่ยวข้องเมื่อสิบห้าปีก่อน นำมาสู่จุดจบความสัมพันธ์ในครั้งนี้

เรื่องปมคดีฆาตกรรมนี่เดาไม่ออกเลย มาเฉลยเอาสิบหน้าสุดท้ายได้มั้ง แต่สิ่งที่น่าสนใจคือความรู้สึกแต่ละช่วงเวลาของการนอกใจ ทั้งความรู้สึกของตัวเอง ชู้รัก คนรอบข้าง ภรรยาที่เลือกจะปิดตาหนึ่งข้างเพื่อรักษาความสัมพันธ์ มันไม่มีใครมีความสุขจริงเลยๆ ล้วนตกนรกในใจทั้งสิ้น สนุกดราม่าดี",4,,32

หนังสือเล่มนี้เป็นดราม่าเข้มข้น ที่แซมด้วยการฆาตกรรม มีกลิ่นของสืบสวนสอบสวนนิดๆ
ดำเนินเรื่องด้วยตัวเอกหนุ่มใหญ่ผู้มีครอบครัวแล้ว กับชู้สาววัยสามสิบ

เปิดเรื่องด้วยความสัมพันธ์ชู้สาวแบบจัดหนัก
ลงลึกถึงความรู้สึกนึกคิดและสภาพจิตใจของคนที่กำลังคบชู้กัน
ไม่มีการเล่นกับมโนธรรมสำนึกของผู้อ่านเพราะแน่นอนว่าการมีชู้มันเป็นสิ่งที่มองให้ถูกยากเหลือเกิน
Keigo จึงเล่นงานคนอ่านโดยการสร้างตัวละครที่ทั้งน่าลุ่มหลง น่าเห็นใจ และน่าโมโห
จนอดไม่ได้ที่จะสงสัยว่า เฮ้ย จะเอางี้จริงเหรอ?

ความสัมพันธ์ที่หลบๆ ซ่อนๆ มีทั้งความรู้สึกปีติและผิดบาป ที่ถูกถ่ายทอดลงมาอย่างไร้ที่ติ
ดำเนินคู่ไปกับเวลาที่อายุความจะหมดของคดีฆาตกรรมในบ้านหญิงสาวเมื่อ 15 ปีก่อน

เป็นการฆาตกรรมชู้รักของพ่อในบ้านของเธอ
และในขณะนั้น เธอเป็นคนเดียวที่อยู่กับผู้ตาย

""นครรุ่งอรุณ"" คือรุ่งเช้าตอนที่เขาและเธอต่างต้องแยกจากกัน
ต่างคนต่างต้องใช้ชีวิตของตัวเอง โดยปิดบังและหลบซ่อนมันเอาไว้
เพื่อพบกันใหม่ตอนพลบค่ำในวันที่โอกาสอำนวย...
เพื่อที่จะแยกจากกันอีกครั้ง...
วนไปอย่างนั้น ราวกับถูกสาป

ขอบอกตามตรงว่าครึ่งเล่มแรก อ่านแล้ววาง อ่านแล้ววางหลายรอบ
ด้วยความที่ฝีมือปั้นความสัมพันธ์ฉันชู้ ถูก Keigo ป้อนใส่จนหงุดหงิดตัวละคร
แทบจะคาดเดาไม่ได้เลยว่าคู่นี้จะจบโดยการตกนรกหมกไหม้ยังไง

ส่วนคดีฆาตกรรมนั้นก็พยายามเดาตอนจบว่า ""ใครฆ่า"" เช่นเคย
ไม่มีเบาะแส มีแต่ความลับที่หญิงสาวเก็บไว้กับตัวมาตลอด 15 ปี

แต่พอเริ่มอินกับตัวละคร Keigo ก็มาเร่งเครื่อง เดินเรื่องอย่างเข้มข้นเอาครึ่งหลัง
เล่นซะจนวางไม่ลง

สิ่งที่คาดเดาไว้ต่างๆ นานา นั้นผิดหมด วางเฉลย climax ไว้ท้ายเล่มเช่นเคย มันทั้งหมดจด หักมุม และแอบซึ้งเล็กๆ

渡邊快四十歲了，家有妻女，工作也小有所成。即便妻子是位好媽媽好太太，渡邊卻總是覺得空虛，他不滿於現狀，一想到一輩子都要過著一成不變的生活他便覺得窒息。他明知道自己早已過了可以執著於戀愛的年齡，卻無法自拔的愛上新來的女同事秋葉。

渡邊沉浸在與情人的熱戀中，警察卻找上了他，並告知他秋葉是十五年前一樁命案的嫌疑人，而且這件案子的訴訟時效馬上就要到期了。他想相信秋葉，但心裡的懷疑悄悄的萌芽，他突然意識到自己對這個深愛的女人其實一無所知。

渡邊原本打算在聽完秋葉的剖白後去向妻子攤牌離婚，卻不知道這一場婚外情只是秋葉報復父親的遊戲。時效到期，秋葉當著渡邊和父親的面前，緩緩說出她背負了15年的秘密。想當年，兩個最差勁的人，為了隱瞞自己的婚外情而犧牲了另一個女人。當時還是高中生的秋葉卻沒有機會說出真相，為父親的錯誤背了15年命案嫌疑人的罪名。

「結婚後，就不要再和異性談戀愛了。
要是沈湎其中，最後只會把自己弄得遍體鱗傷。」

這本書和東野圭吾一貫的作品不同，是一部探討婚姻的傑作。命案只是點綴，主要是對婚姻中的男女、婚外情中的男女、以及受婚外情牽連的家人細緻的描寫。這本書同時也可說是一位已婚男人出軌的自白書，他不想失去原本美好的家庭，又想和年輕漂亮的女同事廝混。明明畏縮、膽小又虛偽，卻在情人面前表現得無所顧忌。一邊享受著偷情帶來的刺激，一邊為自己將拋妻棄女感到自責。這男人的小心思小把戲，油膩得、噁心得令人作嘔。書裡頭的感情糾結很現實，不安定的已婚男人把浪漫的白首不相離搞得就像是一場鬧劇。看清了婚姻的真相，難怪現在的年輕人對婚姻的需求越來越淡薄。
擇一城終老，遇一人白首，有那麼難嗎？

ในขณะที่คนเขียนเล่าความสัมพันธ์ต้องห้าม จากผู้ชายที่เคยนึกรังเกียจพฤติกรรมการนอกใจ ไม่เคยเห็นหญิงสาวคนไหนอยู่ในสายตานอกจากภรรยา จนได้ทำความรู้จักพนักงานสาวที่เพิ่งเข้ามาทำงานใหม่ในบริษัทเดียวกัน ก่อเกิดความสัมพันธ์เลยเถิดไปไกลจนกลายเป็นชู้

ชอบการเล่าเรียงนั้น ชอบการค่อยๆบอกถึงพัฒนาการนั้น จากคนที่บอกว่าไม่ จะเปลี่ยนเป็นใช่ จนสุดท้ายไม่สามารถปฎิเสธอะไรได้นั้นเป็นอย่างไร เคโงะยังคงลงรายละเอียดจิตใจคนได้อย่างดี

ชอบการเล่าประเด็นของครอบครัว เมื่อชายหญิงตกลงใช้ชีวิตร่วมกัน หลังแต่งงานพวกเขาก็ไม่ได้เป็นผู้ชายหรือผู้หญิงอีกต่อไปแล้ว แต่จะกลายเป็นสามี ภรรยา หรือกลายไปเป็นพ่อกับแม่ให้ใครอีกคน พวกเขาต่างค่อยๆหมดความสนใจ หมดความตื่นเต้น หมดความร้องแรง หมดความโหยหากันและกัน ที่มาแทนที่คือหน้าที่และตัวตนที่ไม่จำเป็นต้องประดิษฐ์ปกปิดอีกต่อไป

แต่ไม่ใช่ว่าชายคนนี้มีเมียไม่ดีถึงต้องไปคบชู้หรืออะไร ตรงข้ามเธอทำหน้าที่แม่และภรรยาได้ดี ไม่ขาดตกบกพร่อง ไม่เคยทำให้เขาอึดอัดใจเลยสักครั้ง คนที่เปลี่ยนใจคือเขาเองต่างหาก

เมื่อลองตัดสินใจแล้วว่าจะคบชู้ ก็ต้องทนทรมานกับการต้องเก็บเรื่องชู้รักไว้ในใจ และก่อนที่เขาจะก้าวไปขั้นต่อไปคือการเลือกผู้หญิงอีกคนมากกว่าครอบครัว คนเขียนก็ลงบททดสอบว่านี่คือความรักแท้แน่จริงหรือที่ผ่านมาแค่อารมณ์พาไป ..กันแน่
เราจะเห็นมุมมองของผู้ชายคนหนึ่ง ที่พยายามทำทุกอย่างเพื่อชู้รักของเขาด้วยความจริงใจ หนักแน่น แต่เบื้องหลังเกี่ยวกับตัวเธอก็ค่อยๆสั่นคลอนความหนักแน่นของเขาไปเรื่อยๆ พร้อมๆกับที่เราก็อยากรู้ว่าเธอเกี่ยวข้องกับคดีฆาตกรรมเมื่อ 15 ปีก่อนยังไงกันแน่

เมื่อลองจะรักกันแล้ว เราก็ต้องเชื่อใจ จับมือเคียงข้างกันผ่านอุปสรรคไปด้วยกันมิใช่หรือ?...
แต่หากเวลานั้นมาถึง เมื่อเราได้รู้ความจริง เราจะยังยืนเคียงข้างกันได้จริงๆหรือ...?
เมื่อทั้งความรัก ความเชื่อมั่นถูกทดสอบ
เราจะยังรักเขาได้อีกหรือไม่ เมื่อรู้ทั้งรู้ในความผิดของอีกฝ่าย รักทั้งที่รู้ จะยังคงเต็มใจเดินเคียงข้าง ให้อภัยอีกฝ่ายได้หรือไม่ ...

ในตอนจบนั้นมีหักศอกกันบ้าง อึ้งนิดๆอยู่บ้าง และอาจยังไม่สะใจคนอ่านเมื่อยังไม่เห็นพระเอกเจ็บปวดกับสิ่งที่ตนทำเท่าไหร่
แต่หากมองให้ดีๆ ตอนจบนั้นก็มีความลึกซึ้งและสมบูรณ์โดยไม่จำเป็นต้องเอื้อนเอ่ยคำใดให้มากความก็เป็นได้

Quite excited to get into the head of someone who experiences an affair even though he was completely sure he wouldn’t be so dumb, you know, 未雨绸缪 防患未然 for the future. Had high hopes for 东野圭吾 too, he’s usually very good at unearthing layers of human psychology.

The starting chapters were simple yet effective at pulling me in, portraying this normal salaryman. What was very lacking though was the description of his family and marriage which I thought would be very important in this kind of book about why affairs happen.

Then. Then. I completely don’t understand how this responsible family guy salaryman quickly loses control of himself, and fails spectacularly at drawing boundaries between himself and his female colleague??? 这么基本的错误？？？ I mean I understand if he feels an attraction towards another person, but not when he does nothing to minimise interactions with her but instead eggs himself on. Wts.

Maybe my expectations of the book were wrong. I was expecting to root for a strong morally sound character, that committed an affair in some extenuating circumstances. So far there’s nothing extenuating about it.

ฆาตกรรมแนว close circle ที่อ่านแล้วรู้สึกว่ามันจะสมบูรณ์ ลงตัวไปนิดนึง

เรื่องเปิดด้วยความตายของว่าที่เจ้าสาว ก่อนวันแต่งงานเพียงไม่กี่วัน สิ่งที่หลงเหลืออยู่คือความโศกเศร้าในครอบครัว
เธอตายจากอุบัติเหตุจริงรึเปล่า?
แม้เวลาจะผ่านไป ว่าที่ลูกเขย ยังคงมีความสัมพันธ์ผูกพันกับครอบครัวของว่าที่เจ้าสาว พวกเขาจึงรวมตัวกันไปพักผ่อนที่บ้านพักตากอากาศ
เรื่องมันมายุ่งตรงที่ดันเจอกลุ่มโจรที่หนีจากการปล้นธนาคารมากบดาน จับพลัดจับผลูมาจับทุกคนไว้เป็นตัวประกันในบ้านหลังนั้น
แถมยังมีคนตายเพิ่มขึ้นอีก
ฆาตกรรมใน close circle จึงบังเกิด

เนื้อเรื่องดำเนินเนิบๆ ไม่หวือหวา แต่ก็ไม่สามารถวางหนังสือลงได้ด้วย magic ของ Keigo
อยากรู้เหมือนกันว่า Keigo จะพาไปถึงจุดไหน
เจ้าสาวตายจากอุบัติเหตุหรือไม่? ทำไมโจรถึงเลือกมาบ้านหลังนี้? ใครฆ่าคนอีกคนหนึ่ง? และฆ่าทำไม?

แต่พอถึงเฉลยตอนท้ายเล่ม ถึงทั้งคนฆ่า เหตุจูงใจ และปมอื่นๆ ก็อึ้งๆ ไปเหมือนกัน เพราะมันดูลงตัว แนบเนียน แบบหักมุมเกินไปหน่อย

The first time I laid my hands on this book, I couldn't stop but reading because the story was so intense I had to find out what was going to happen next. About ten people who have known each other for years meet up in a mountain villa that belongs to the highest man from those. They believe they have met only for the purpose of enjoying the meetup, but unexpected guests soon come to invade the villa. They were thieves and were looking for a place to hide from the police when they found the villa the people were currently using. The two thieves easily capture all people in the villa and keep everyone in charge while they rest and rob the house. Threatened by the weapons, the people had no choice but to follow the thieves. Soon, an unfortunate murder case happens in the villa. One of the hostages is dead, and everyone is busy suspecting others. Like a well-written play in performance, this book creates suspense between the invited guests and the two thieves in the middle of the escalation, and you can feel joy with a huge twister at the end.

As readers who are trying to figure out who the criminal is, the author does not fail to surprise us at the end. Higashino Keigo is famous for his mystery thriller murder books, and I definitely think this book is one of his best work.",5,1 like,33

ฝ่ายพ่อแม่ของ ผญ ที่ตายก็สนิทกับพระเอกและไม่อยากให้ห่างเหินกัน ด็เรียกพระเอกมาพักผ่อนที่บ้านพักตากอากาศแล้วก็เชิญคนใกล้ตัวมาอีกจำนวนนึง
แล้วจู่ๆก็มีโจร 2 คนบุกมาในบ้านจับทุกคนเป็นตัวประกัน
พอเริ่มอ่านถึงตรงนี้ก็งงๆนิดนึงว่า เรื่องนี้ทิศทางของมันจะไปทางไหน
แล้วจากนั้นปรากฏว่ามีเหตุฆาตกรรมเกิดขึ้น แล้ว 2 โจรที่บุกมายืนยันว่าไม่ได้ทำ นั่นแปลว่าคนในบ้านพักที่ถูกจับเป็นตัวประกันต้องเป็นฆาตกรแน่ๆ

2. 在所有人都被绑起来蒙住眼睛推测凶手的时候，下条问了一个问题说“看到了SOS的人请举手”，然后书里说没有人举手。但这个时候除了歹徒以外的所有人都是被蒙着眼的，被蒙着眼睛的下条不可能问问题的时候让人举手，剩下被蒙着眼的人也不可能看到有没有人举手。我觉得是个作者的bug哈哈哈哈。

我个人不太看好的一点就是“主角是凶手”这种剧情，但这并不是针对东野圭吾或者这本书。我个人不喜欢这种设计的原因是因为我比较喜欢传统的“本格推理”，也就是跟着故事给出的线索试着找出凶手。但是，当读者跟着主角视角了解故事的时候部分事实会被主角“隐瞒”，因此做不到根据线索推理出真相。

กาลิเลโอไขคดียุ่งเหยิง เป็นรวมเรื่องสั้น 5 เรื่อง ในซีรีย์นักสืบกาลิเลโอ ที่มี “คดียุ่งเหยิง” เป็นเรื่องปิดท้าย
ปกติเรื่องสั้นของ Keigo จะไม่สามารถบิวด์ดราม่าได้เต็มอิ่ม แต่รวมเล่มนี้แก้ไขข้อด้อยของความเป็นเรื่องสั้นด้วยการเพิ่มความยาว ผลคือ Keigo ร่ายเวทย์ได้แบบจัดเต็ม

เรื่องสั้นที่อ่านแล้วชอบอย่างโดดเด่นคือ “ชักใย” และ “ยุ่งเหยิง”

ที่ชอบเพราะทั้งสองเรื่องนี้ มี “ยุกาว่า” อาจารย์กาลิเลโอ นักวิทยาศาสตร์ผู้ใช้พลังของวิทยาศาสตร์เป็นทั้งแกนของดราม่าและเป็นทั้งผู้ไขคดี

ใน “ชักใย” แสดงให้เห็นบุคลิกความเป็นมนุษย์ของยุกาว่าได้ชัดเจนมาก
ปกติแล้วจะคุ้นเคยกับ character นักฟิสิกส์แข็งๆ ไร้หัวใจ แต่ในตอน “ชักใย” ที่ยุกาว่าต้องมาไขคดีฆาตกรรมที่เกิดขึ้นในบ้านของอาจารย์ผู้มีพระคุณของตัวเองเจ้าของฉายาพ่อมดโลหะ (คนญี่ปุ่นนี่ตั้งฉายากันได้การ์ตูนมาก)
การตายที่แปลกประหลาดด้วยอาวุธที่เกินจินตนาการ ส่วนพ่อมดโลหะก็คุมโลหะได้ดังใจนึก และการไขคดี ก็อาศัยมันสมองของยุกาว่ามาช่วยเฉลย ที่สำคัญที่สุดคือตอนจบ จบได้ดราม่าหักมุมอย่างแรง กลายเป็นส่วนผสมที่ลงตัวมาก

ส่วน “ยุ่งเหยิง” ก็เป็นคดีฆาตกรรมที่ทำให้เหมือนเกิดอุบัติเหตุด้วยเทคนิคทางวิทยาศาสตร์ที่ล้ำลึกเช่นกัน เพราะฆาตกรใช้ความรู้ทางวิทยาศาสตร์ก่อเหตุ โดยมียุกาว่า ที่ตกเป็นเป้าของการล้างแค้น
“มือปีศาจ” คืออาชญากรจิตไม่ปกติ ที่มีความแค้นต่อยุกาว่าเป็นมูลเหตุจูงใจ
ที่มันสนุกเพราะตอนนี้เปิดให้ดราม่าทำงานแบบจัดเต็มควบคู่ไปกับการเดินเรื่องที่กระชับ ที่จัด แถมตอนนี้ก็ให้ความยาวเป็นร้อยหน้า เรียกได้ว่าจุใจ",4,4 likes,34

เรื่อง ""ร่วงหล่น"" เป็นเรื่องแรกในเล่ม เราอ่านแบบไม่คาดหวัง เพราะก็เคยอ่านเรื่องสั้นจากซีรีย์คางะมา เลยไม่คาดหวังอะไรมาก แต่ตกใจค่ะ เปิดเล่มมาเรื่องแรก คือดึงเข้าเรื่องเร็วมาก เรื่องเดินไวมาก ฉับๆๆๆ แล้วก็จบแล้ว โห... สนุกมากเลย

เรื่อง ""ชักใย"" สนุกขนาดที่ว่าเราสงสัยมากว่าทำไมอาจารย์ถึงเขียนเป็นเรื่องสั้นล่ะ เนื้อหาก็ดี ปมของตัวละครก็ดี เรื่องนี้มันยกไปเขียนเป็นนิยายเล่มใหญ่ได้นะ และเราว่าถ้าตีฟูอีกนิด ขยี้อารมณ์เพิ่มอีกนิดนึง เราว่าระดับการทำร้ายจิตใจคนอ่านจะพอๆ กันกับ ""สมการเปื้อนเลือด"" กับ ""กลลวงซ่อนตาย"" ระดับนั้นได้เลย คืองง... ทำไมถึงเลือกมาเขียนเป็นเรื่องสั้นหว่า เรื่องนี้สนุกค่ะ

เรื่อง ""ปิดตาย"" เราก็นึกว่าคุณเคโงะจะใช้มุขเดียวแบบโคนัน ประมาณว่ารศ.ยุคาว่าไปที่ไหนก็มีแต่คนตาย เหมือนที่โคนันไปไหนก็ต้องมีคนตาย เปล่าจ้า... ไม่จำเป็นเสมอไป บางทีก็มีกรณีคนตายไปแล้ว แต่มีคนสงสัยเลยมาปรึกษารศ.ยุคาว่านั่นเอง ด้วยทริคแล้ว เราว่าตอนนี้สนุกค่ะ ชอบความสัมพันธ์ของยุคาว่ากับเพื่อนด้วย นานๆ ทีคบคนอื่นบ้างนอกจากคุซานางิก็น่ารักดีค่ะ

เรื่อง ""ชี้นำ"" เราชอบเรื่องนี้ค่ะ เก๋อ่ะ เป็นเรื่องเกี่ยวกับ ""ดาวซิ่ง"" ค่ะ ไม่คาดคิดว่าจะได้อ่านเรื่องนี้ในงานชุดกาลิเลโอเลย น้องตัวละครเอกของตอนนี้เป็นเด็กประถม น้องใช้สร้อยที่ห้อยจี้คริสตัลสำหรับการดาวซิ่ง แต่ตอนนี้มีฉากโหดนิดหน่อย ถ้าไม่นับตรงนั้น เราว่าตอนนี้สนุกค่ะ

เรื่อง ""ยุ่งเหยิง"" ตอนนี้เป็นตอนที่ดูไม่กาลิเลโอที่สุดเท่าที่เราเคยอ่านมา คงเพราะอาชญากรพยายามจะทำให้ตัวเองดูยิ่งใหญ่ล่ะมั้ง อ่านแล้วนึกถึงโคนันภาคที่เป็นหนังเลยค่ะ และเป็นครั้งแรกที่เราเดาวิธีการของคนร้ายถูกด้วย (แต่อธิบายด้วยหลักฟิสิกส์ไม่ได้หรอกนะ)

สรุปว่า เกินคาดค่ะ เป็นเรื่องสั้นที่สนุกที่สุดของคุณเคโงะเท่าที่เคยอ่านมา
ยังเหลือเล่มกาลิเลโอไขคดี(ปกสีขาว) อีกเล่มนึงที่เป็นเรื่องสั้นเหมือนกันยังไม่ได้อ่าน

5 stars

DCI Kusanagi and his partner Detective Kaoru Utsumi catch a very difficult case which has ties to the past. When Kusanagi was just a beginning detective, he assisted on a case where the police knew without a doubt who committed the murder. However, the murderer was found not guilty in court.

Is he back? Could this latest murder of another young woman be his work?

This case is very complicated and the detectives need input from Manabu “Galileo” Yukawa, a very talented physicist who has a knack for police work.

When their main suspect turns up dead at a community celebration, the case is thrown into chaos. All of their suspects for his murder have solid alibis. So, who committed the crime?

This is an extremely well written and plotted novel. It is a complicated read, but stick with it. It is well worth the experience. Mr. Higashino is a master at the use of words to paint pictures. The reader is there witnessing everything. I really enjoyed this book and went immediately to Amazon to look at his other books. I look forward to reading more from him.

I want to thank NetGalley and St. Martin's Press for forwarding to me a copy of this great book for me to read, enjoy and review. The opinions expressed here are my own.",5,0 likes,34
review_4082794901,Fene,"Jun 28, 2021","《墜落》
傢俬銷售員前腳剛離開公寓，女人便接著從陽台一躍而下。已婚銷售員和女人是情人關係，兩人見面其實是為了談判，女人要脅銷售員離婚而激怒了對方，一氣之下被對方用鍋子給打倒了。雖然銷售員的嫌疑最大，但是案發時銷售員的確在公寓樓下目睹了墜樓一幕，還撞上了一名披薩外送員，有著完美的不在場證明。到底是不是真的能製作出把屍體拋下的定時裝置呢?

《伽利略的苦惱》
湯川的恩師約了一眾門生到家裡敘舊，對面的別館卻突然起火燒了起來。火被撲滅後，老師的兒子的屍體被發現倒在了窗戶旁邊，事先被利刃刺穿胸膛後遭焚屍。伽利略看穿了整件事情的來龍去脈，不惜懇求兇手去自首。但他卻沒想到，自己其實完全被兇手操控了，兇手正正需要湯川的智慧來為警方解開謎團，將自己繩之於法。一般嫌疑犯都希望得到從輕判處，但這一名兇手卻希望自己的刑期越長越好，最好能夠死在牢裡。

《密室》
民宿裡的一名客人，在門窗反鎖的情況下竟在民宿外跌下峽谷當場死亡。民宿老闆對於警方的非他殺判定心存疑慮，於是找來了湯川學，希望解開密室詭計。然而，案發時死者的窗戶是開著的，根本就沒有什麼密室之談。老闆將一間不是密室的房間說成密室，態度極不自然。眼看湯川即將揭露出一些隱情，老闆慌忙拜托湯川別再追問不休，並阻止他繼續糾纏。

《指示》
母親的保險客戶，一名老奶奶在家人出國旅行時在家裡被勒斃，藏在神臺裡的10公斤金條遭偷走，幫忙看家的黑狗也同時不見蹤影。女孩對自己的的水晶靈擺深信不疑，堅信只要不是用在私慾上，就沒有靈擺不能回答的問題。女孩為了替母親洗清嫌疑，在得到靈擺的指示下找到了黑狗的屍體。不料，湯川在見了女孩之後，卻給出了女孩其實在撒謊的結論。

《擾亂》
一名自稱惡魔之手的歹徒向警方寄了匿名信，說自己有能力隨心所欲地殺人，而警方只能將被害人的死判定為自然事故，他甚至公然挑戰湯川學，要和湯川學一較高下看看到底誰才是真正的天才。對於這個對自己滿懷恨意的傢伙，湯川毫無頭緒，對方卻一意孤行地認為自己原本鋪好的科學家之路，在一場學術會上被湯川堵死了。

把伽利略系列擱在一旁好長一段時間了，現在好啦，告別恭一郎以後，可以好好和湯川學交流交流了。既然是短篇故事，就不能期望它能像長篇那樣給讀者跌宕起伏一波三折的故事情節。《伽利略的苦惱》和系列裡的首兩部作品一樣，都是由5篇短篇故事組成，然而，相較之下，《伽利略的苦惱》的敘事手法會比早期兩部作品來得成熟，情節過渡也不生硬，架構簡單卻不失起承轉合的概念。雖說是短篇故事，但這一部伽利略我還是讀得挺過癮的。",4,0 likes,34

review_2571125103,Nattapan,"Oct 24, 2018","I always wonder what makes someone a criminal, and how to deal with guilt and regret after a crime.

This book reminds me of the article by Nick Chester discussing about the close relationship between crimes and rationalization.

This is an excerpt from that article,

""...According to criminal psychology expert Shadd Maruna, studies indicate that the majority of criminals either make excuses for, or attempt to justify, their actions. There's little evidence that these justifications are made prior to committing the crimes, so it's possible—and somewhat likely—that they're thought up afterwards as a way to mitigate the guilt.""

review_3747387653,Guido Calderini,"Nov 13, 2021","I couldn't finish the last story. This series is dumb, but this one takes it to a whole new level (or rather the same trite and unimaginative one, but with less effort trying to be interesting or believable).

Once again, the surprisingly clueless team of detectives get their mysteries solved by a physics professor with way too much time on his time and a knack for recreating high-school level ""experiments"" in his lab. Luckily for everyone, every single villain goes through the trouble of using the most convoluted, yet easy to track method to kill their victim, making it possible for this group of clowns to eventually reveal to the reader how it was done.

The problem with having every single one of your stories revolve around some barely interesting natural phenomena is that after a while it gets old, and we are just left with some bland characters and a meaningless plot.

P.S. The one where the guy makes a hologram of the lock and Kagawa recreates it in his lab may be the stupidest denouement in all of fiction.",1,0 likes,34

Cuốn sách hiếm hoi của Keigo không có yếu tố trinh thám, mà tập trung vào các mối quan hệ, đặc biệt là góc nhìn và tình trạng hôn nhân của những thanh niên tuổi 30 của Nhật Bản.

Mình thích văn phong của Keigo, vừa đủ nhẹ nhàng, vừa đủ hấp dẫn và khiến có cảm xúc trong trải nghiệm đọc.

Câu chuyện không xuất sắc, thông điệp không ấn tượng là điểm trừ lớn. Nhưng đây cũng là cơ hội để nhìn thấy một góc khác trong cách viết của Keigo.

Đừng mặc định sách của Keigo đều là trinh thám nhé anh em, vì tớ thấy thật ra phần lớn sẽ thiên tâm lý đó 🤩
Mỗi câu chuyện, Keigo đều chọn một chủ đề và cuốn người đọc vào những tình huống tiến thoái lưỡng nan, làm ta băn khoăn không biết phải làm thế nào và thấy ái ngại cho nhân vật. Lần này, chủ đề mà Keigo hướng tới là tình yêu cùng sự phản bội, và tất nhiên là các nhân vật lại tiếp tục quay cuồng trong những khoảnh khắc ‘người tính không bằng trời tính’.

‘Cáp treo tình yêu’ được chia làm nhiều mẩu truyện nhỏ, với hệ thống nhân vật xuất hiện đan xen và có thể khiến chúng ta nghĩ cuộc đời họ sẽ chẳng liên quan tới nhau nữa. Rồi tới những chương cuối, họ bỗng được tác giả đưa lại gần nhau, tớ cảm giác trái đất thật nhỏ bé và những người có duyên nợ lại va phải nhau vậy. Có những đoạn mạch hơi chậm, khiến nhớ lại hồi đọc ‘Trứng chim cúc cu này thuộc về ai’ vậy đó, nhưng màu sắc của ‘Cáp treo tình yêu’ rất tươi sáng nên không làm cho câu chuyện bị trầm buồn.

Cuốn này cũng có 1 cái kết khiến tớ rất bất ngờ, kiểu mọi thứ đang bình thường thì rẽ ngoặt cua gấp luôn ngay trang cuối 😂 Lúc đọc xong đi mò mẫm xem mọi người nghĩ sao về cái kết thì hoá ra mỗi người lại có lí giải riêng, thú vị lắm nhưng thôi Chi không spoil đâuuu 🥳 Anh em hãy đọc và khám phá nhé 🥳
Bonus bìa xinh xẻo từ chị Tamypu nữa awwwwwwwww 🥬🥬🥬

review_3554866122,Jin,"Sep 18, 2020","I can't believe I haven't included this one to my book list! I already read it last year and as a huge fan of Keigo Higashino, I liked it. It was very interesting to see his way of telling romantic stories. Some people are just born to be story tellers and Keigo Higashino is definitely one of them.

예상했던 대로 로맨스를 특유의 스타일로 풀어가며 세상에서 제일 오래된 사람사이의 미스테리인 사랑의 관계를 재미있게 진부하지 않게 감동과 함께 풀어나간다. 단편집이긴 하지만 사람과 사람의 관계를 서로 떡처럼 쫀득하게 엮어서 마지막 페이지를 읽은 후 서로와의 관계로 큰 그림이 그려지는 책이었다. 특히나 눈과 산, 스노우보딩으로 더 특별한 상황을 만들어 더 큰 흥미가 생겼고 예를 들어 첫번째 단편부터 모모미의 고타의 이야기도 스노우보딩의 특별한 세팅이 없었다면 애초에 아찔함과 재미가 없었지 않았을까. 하여간 모든 요소가 자연스럽게 녹여져 거부감 없이 마지막 단편까지 꽤 재미있게 읽었다. 개인적으로 마지막에 모모미와 히다가 잘 이어졌으면 좋겠다는 생각까지 들었다.

연애소설의 단골인 감정과 사람의 엇갈림, 헤매며 마지막에 만남으로 끝나는 단편들. 매번 드는 생각이지만 남자 작가가 여자의 생각이나 섬세하고 미묘한 행동을 잘 묘사하는 점이 매번 신기하다.",4,,35

Mình đọc cuốn này khá từ tốn để phân biệt được rõ các nhân vật, nên không thấy bị rối hay khó hiểu như 1 số bạn nhận xét. Các nhân vật tuy không được miêu tả quá chi tiết về gia cảnh nhưng vẫn có những nét tính cách đặc trưng riêng, và mỗi câu chuyện xoay quanh họ lại có những điểm thú vị độc đáo, đúng thực sự là phải bật cười ấy, nhưng không hoàn toàn vì vui thú mà vì mấy tình huống ấy éo le, oái oăm biết bao :))

Dù có ác ý hay vô tình đi nữa, mỗi người đều muốn điều tốt nhất cho bản thân mình, hoặc tìm cách lấp liếm đi những cái sai đã làm với người khác. Trách Kota mười thì cũng phải trách Mizuki ba bốn phần, thương Miyuki một thì phải thương Hida với Momomi mười.

Ban đầu mình cũng không kỳ vọng lắm về cuốn này vì nó không thuộc dòng trinh thám, nhưng thực sự đọc xong mình phải thán phục sự đa dạng trong sáng tác và khéo léo trong cài cắm những tình huống tưởng như không liên quan mà lại có hệ luỵ mật thiết với nhau của bác Keigo.",4,1 like,35

#Cáp_treo_tình_yêu #KeigoHigashino #Jan0103 #y2020 #Mintbooks
Khai bút đầu năm (dương) bằng một cuốn cũng mơi mới của Keigo. Với tốc độ sáng tác và mua bản quyền cũng như vô số nhà xuất bản nắm bắt được thị hiếu thì truyện của Keigo ở Việt Nam xuất bản nhiều như gà đẻ trứng. Thay vì chọn những cuốn nặng đề tài xã hội hay trinh thám, Mintbooks lựa chọn Cáp treo tình yêu, theo mình là một option khá nhẹ nhàng.
Cáp treo tình yêu, đúng như tựa đề, hiểu đơn giản là những câu truyện tình yêu được diễn ra tại khu trượt tuyết tại khu nước nóng Satozawa. Những người trẻ tuổi (theo như truyện thì họ cũng không trẻ lắm, nhưng mình nghĩ với 1 nước dân số già thì 30-40 vẫn là trẻ chán), họ gặp nhau, yêu nhau, đôi khi họ lầm tưởng đấy là tình yêu, đôi khi họ lầm tưởng tình yêu là trọn đời, rồi những cái lầm tưởng lại trở thành tội lỗi. Trọn vẹn như một vòng cáp treo, có đi lên thì phải đi xuống, bắt đầu và kết thúc đều từ một cuộc gặp gỡ trong cáp treo, nơi thế giới dù rộng lớn thế mà ta vẫn tình cờ gặp những việc vô cùng oái ăm.
Ở lời tựa trên bìa 4, cuốn truyện được giới thiệu “Đứng trước tình yêu, con người sẽ trở nên thảm hại, ích kỷ, hoặc nhiều dũng khí đến thế nào?”. Có lẽ cũng đúng một phần, nhưng mình muốn nhìn theo hướng rộng hơn, rằng cách xử lý tình huống trong tình yêu, cũng là cách chúng ta hành xử với xã hội và những mối quan hệ xung quanh. Một Kota luôn tìm điều có lợi cho bản thân, sẵn sàng đổ lỗi cho người khác, một Miyuki những tưởng nắm bắt được mọi người nhưng hóa ra vẫn không hiểu được hết dù là người sống cạnh cô hàng ngày, một Momomi những tưởng cam chịu dễ tính nhưng lại luôn suy nghĩ kỹ trước khi lựa chọn bước vào một mối quan hệ, hay một Mizuki sống với tôn chỉ: “lời nói chẳng mất tiền mua, lựa lời mà nói cho vừa lòng nhau” nhưng chỉ khát khao thỏa mãn mong muốn của bản thân,…
Những con người xuất hiện trong truyện không quá xa lạ, mình sẽ gặp đầy xung quanh luôn. Keigo vẫn rất tài tình trong việc biến những đề tài quen thuộc thành một câu chuyện hay ho. Cái hay nhất trong Cáp treo tình yêu với mình là việc tạo nên dòng thời gian. Dù mạch truyện nhanh, nhưng rõ ràng những tình huống xảy ra trên khu trượt tuyết của Satozawa không phải trong ngày một ngày hai. Có những cú nhảy thời gian: 1 năm, 4 tháng. 6 tháng…Việc này khiến mình thấy truyện hợp lý, khá là “đời”, chứ không phải việc không thể xảy ra, hay những cái mà mình phải chặc miệng “truyện mà”. Dòng thời gian dài cũng giúp các mối quan hệ được xây dựng trong truyện không khiên cưỡng chút nào.
Cách Keigo sử dụng kết mở cho mọi tình huống xảy ra tại khu trượt tuyết cũng đặt người đọc vào tình trạng phải tự vẽ nên cái kết mình mong muốn. Nghĩa là chẳng có chính – tà, đúng – sai , chỉ đơn giản là mỗi người đọc tự đoán định cái kết cục mà mình muốn – hoặc kết cục mà mình thỏa mãn nhất: có thể là họ vẫn bên nhau, có thể là Hida sẽ vẫn lựa chọn làm tiếp những gì dang dở, cũng có thể Miyuki sẽ lại lần nữa nhắm mắt cho qua và nghĩ rằng đang nắm điểm yếu của người khác,…
Dĩ nhiên, khen thì khen thế, nhưng mình không thích truyện này. Mình cũng không bất ngờ với bất kỳ phần nào của truyện. Hoặc có lẽ cuộc đời mình may mắn cũng gặp kha khá tình huống như thế nên đọc đến đâu đã hình dung ra bước tiếp theo như nào. Chính vì thế với cái tựa giới thiệu “đứng trước tình yêu…” mình chả thích, bởi tình yêu hay tình bạn hay dăm ba cái quan hệ, quan trọng chỉ là lựa chọn của mỗi người, và chẳng ai có quyền ngồi phán xét rằng lựa chọn cách sống như thế là đúng hay sai (dĩ nhiên trừ mấy cái phạm pháp hẳn ra nhé), như câu trích ở đầu bài viết: “Cũng có lúc bản thân mình nghĩ hợp với màu đó thì người ngoài lại nghĩ là không”
Và thực ra,tất cả tình huống xảy ra trong truyện, với mình vẫn là những lời nhắc nhở đã cũ mèm nhưng chẳng bao giờ sai (để năm mới bớt sân si khẩu nghiệp):
- Không muốn người khác biết chỉ có không làm
- Chỉ có cá mới biết sống trong nước thích thế nào
- Tình yêu thì chẳng bao giờ có lỗi, nhưng làm người thì nên có đạo đức",3,2 likes,35

Trong câu chuyện này có rất nhiều nhân vật khác nhau, và tác giả đã kết nối họ lại với nhau bằng những tình huống cả éo le cả lãng mạn. Tới cuối hầu hết mọi người đều được hạnh phúc cả, chỉ còn duyên nợ giữa Momomi và vợ chồng Miyuki thì không biết sẽ thế nào :')

Tuyệt chiêu khai thác diễn biến tâm lý nhân vật của tác giả vẫn phát huy tác dụng hiệu quả như ngày nào. Nhân vật ngoại tình mà mình cũng thấy hồi hộp theo :)) Nói tới chuyện ngoại tình thì có vẻ điều ấy khá phổ biến ở Nhật. Nam nữ có người yêu nhưng chưa kết hôn vẫn có thể ""tìm hiểu"" búa xua thoải mái. Đọc hơi lăn tăn tí vì theo quan điểm của mình thì như vậy là vi phạm đạo đức á 🥴

Chương cuối là bất ngờ và cũng để lại nhiều suy nghĩ cho mình nhất. Đó là những băn khoăn của 1 cô gái khi tự hỏi mình có thật sự yêu thích người kia hay không? hay chỉ là những rung động nhất thời, do người khác vun vào, do tuổi tác đến lúc cần phải xây dựng gia đình? Tình huống khi đối mặt với vấn đề của cô gái và chàng trai cũng rất thú vị :)) Thấy rõ sự khác biệt trong suy nghĩ của nam và nữ. Có lẽ ta nên thẳng thắn thành thật với nhau hơn là cứ suy đoán lung tung rồi thất vọng về nhau. Mấy trang sau chót, tác giả lại dẫn dắt đến cảm xúc hoàn toàn mới. Kết luận lại thì trong mọi câu chuyện phiếm, người có lỗi luôn là người vắng mặt. Khi muốn biện minh cho bản thân thì ai cũng xấu xa vậy đó '..'",3,1 like,35

Rate: 4/5

Vẫn lối viết quen thuộc với các câu chuyện riêng lẻ nhưng đều có một mối liên kết chặt chẽ với nhau, “Cáp treo tình yêu” xoay quanh những éo le về tình yêu mà các cặp đôi thường gặp phải, trong đó các nhân vật chính có đều có chung một mắt xích – cùng đến một khu nghỉ dưỡng trượt tuyết.

Điểm sáng của cuốn này là ở lối tác giả miêu tả tâm lý nhân vật. Tâm lý của ông chồng ngoại tình mà bị bắt quả tang, tâm lý lo lắng khi cầu hôn, tâm lý sau khi đổ vỡ, … tất cả đều rất chân thực và tự nhiên. Mình tin những ai từng đọc cuốn này đều sẽ bật cười ở cách ông xây dựng tình huống một cách rất là tréo ngoe :)) để rồi tò mò bị cuốn vào đó và đọc một lèo hết sạch cả truyện. Truyện của Keigo-sensei thường là kết mở, tuy có chút hụt hẫng nhưng nếu nghĩ theo cách khác thì đó là một cơ hội cho bạn tự tưởng tượng ra cái kết theo ý mình. Lúc đọc xong mình đã cùng một người bạn ngồi tự chế ra cái kết khá là ưng ý, khá là vui :))

Điểm trừ của “Cáp treo tình yêu” là hệ thống nhân vật khó nhớ. Tên người Nhật cứ na ná nhau, lúc gọi tên, lúc gọi họ. Mình bị choáng ở hồi đầu, không phân biệt được giới tính, ai với ai, cứ phải lật qua lật lại xem nhân vật đó đã xuất hiện hay chưa, điều này làm gián đoạn quá trình đọc khiến mình không thoải mái. Sách của Keigo thì đọc lại lần hai sẽ thấy hay hơn, vì lúc đó trong đầu đã hình dung ra nhân vật, và sẽ thật sự chìm đắm vào câu chuyện hơn.

Đây không phải trinh thám mà thiên về tâm lý nên không phù hợp với những bạn thích hành động, bí ẩn, giải đố. Còn nếu bạn thích tâm lý, thì “Cáp treo tình yêu” là dành cho bạn!",4,0 likes,35
review_3678139310,Diệc Điểu,"Dec 05, 2020","Keigo ko cần khai thác quá sâu vào nhân vật, người đọc vẫn biết rõ người nào thế nào, cách sống và tính cách của họ.
Câu chuyện nhẹ nhàng nhưng vẫn lồng ghép được rất nhiều thông điệp: về suy nghĩ của những ng đứng trước ngưỡng cửa hôn nhân, về chuyện tìm bạn đời, về việc ngoại tình trong hành động và trong tâm tưởng, về sự lựa chọn của mỗi người.. Có lẽ ko ai trên đời có thể hiểu hết về ng đang sống bên mình, nhg việc có chấp nhận để họ ở bên ta hay ko là do sự lựa chọn của chính mình.
Cách kể chuyện của Keigo vẫn vậy, cuốn hút qua từng trang sách. Những cú rẽ ngoặt đều thú vị. Bố cục hợp lý. Thủ pháp truyện lồng truyện. Ý nghĩa ẩn dụ trong những vòng cáp treo.
Điểm trừ là cái kết và bìa sách.
Cái kết mở để ng đọc tự suy đoán, nhg trong tr hợp câu chuyện này mình muốn nó dk rõ ràng.
Bìa sách ko xấu nhưng cá nhân mình thấy ko phù hợp, nó sẽ có hiệu quả hơn nếu dùng cho một cuốn ngôn tình trẻ nào đó, bởi ""Cáp treo tình yêu"" theo mình nó là tâm lý xã hội, chứ ko phải ngôn tình cẩu huyết. Chính bìa sách khiến mình ko muốn mua cuốn này vì nghĩ nó ""nông"" và ko hợp với những cuốn anh em cùng ""cha"" của nó mà mình có trên kệ.

review_4578371259,Hoang Pham,"Feb 27, 2022","CÁP TREO TÌNH YÊU là một trong những cuốn tiểu thuyết của Keigo mà tôi tâm đắc nhất trong mảng tâm lý xã hội. Một cuốn sách viết về tình yêu giản dị nhưng không giản đơn, nhẹ nhàng, sâu lắng và ám ảnh bởi những tiếng cười chua cay.

Vì là chuyện tình cảm, chú trọng đến bối cảnh nên Keigo viết với tiết tấu chậm, các tuyến nhân vật tương đối nhiều, các câu chuyện tình của họ lúc đầu khá rời rạc, riêng biệt, chẳng liên quan gì đến nhau. Điển hình như ngay chương đầu tiên, kết chương một cách bất ngờ, thú vị, có thể coi như đã xong một câu chuyện ngắn hài hước. Chương hai tiếp nối với một câu chuyện khác, càng củng cố niềm tin đây chắc là một tuyển tập truyện ngắn. Không, không phải vậy. Khi chương ba nhẹ nhàng trườn vô, mạch truyện phát triển rộng hơn thì những mảnh đời tưởng chừng như không có điểm giao thoa ấy lại được gắn kết với nhau một cách kỳ lạ tại một khu du lịch trượt tuyết nổi tiếng, nơi sự thật thầm kín được phơi bày cùng những tình huống dở khóc dở cười khiến bạn phải bật cười sảng khoái.

Những câu chuyện tình của Keigo đưa ra trong cuốn tiểu thuyết này đâu chỉ có những rung cảm long lanh sắc hồng, ở đó lòng chung thủy đang bị lung lay bởi khao khát kiếm tìm những cảm xúc mới lạ, ước mơ về hạnh phúc gia đình bị thử thách khi buông thả bản thân đắm chìm vào những cuộc hẹn hò đầy cám dỗ nhục dục, lòng bao dung liệu có đủ lớn để tha thứ cho những gian dối trong trò chơi tình ái? Rất khó để trả lời. Thế nhưng, tất cả những tình huống đó chỉ là bối cảnh để Keigo đưa ra một thông điệp rất đáng báo động, đó là vấn nạn của văn hoá nói xấu sau lưng ai đó luôn tồn tại mọi nơi, mọi xã hội. Đó là một thực trạng mà ai cũng thấy. Keigo cũng thế, ông thấy hết, và… Cáp Treo Tình Yêu đã được ông lồng ghép rất nhiều trăn trở về căn bệnh nói dối, cũng như văn hoá nói xấu sau lưng.

Trong đời, nếu ai dám vỗ ngực tuyên bố ""Tôi chưa từng nói dối"" thì cứ inbox tôi, tôi sẽ đến, quỳ gối & cung kính lậy 3 lậy, sau đó ăn gì tôi cúng. Tôi thề có Chúa tôi sẽ làm thế.

Thực ra, nói dối cũng không hẳn xấu. Có muôn vạn đường để lời nói dối được thoát ra cũng như muôn vạn nẻo để sinh tồn trong cuộc đời này. Nói dối mà chẳng ảnh hưởng đến ai mà nó còn tốt cho cả tình huống hiện tại, tốt cho cả mục đích của người nói, thì nói thôi. Kiểu như nói dối nhiều khi là để đối phương đỡ đau hơn, đỡ phải đối diện với nỗi đau. Hoặc giả nói dối vì nói thật có khi còn khiến người khác tổn thương nhiều hơn thế. Vậy nên khi cần người ta vẫn nên nói dối. Dù cho hành vi ấy không được khuyến khích và về cơ bản thì nó vẫn là hành động không tốt. Văn hóa nhân loại nó quy định thế, chứ tôi chẳng biết gì đâu nhá.

Nói dối mà làm tổn thương người ta thì nên tránh. Tuyệt đối tránh. Tất nhiên, trong đời, mấy ai tránh được mãi. Nhưng tránh được lúc nào tốt lúc đó. Vì nó xấu. Thế thôi.

Cuốn sách rất hay, đáng đọc. Cái kết thì siêu siêu đỉnh, shock, đầy hụt hẫng cùng tiếng gào thét của nhân vật trong truyện, và được cộng hưởng bởi tiếng gào đầy cay cú của tôi nữa. Trời ơi! Vậy mà là tình yêu hả, tiêu đề gắn hình ảnh cáp treo với tình yêu mà, nó phải kết thúc đẹp để toát lên biểu tượng cáp treo tình yêu chứ, tình yêu gì mà như thế, vậy là 285 trang sách trước đó bị vứt vô sọt rác hả? Ô hô…a ha…bla bla. Hãy tỉnh táo, nên nhớ Keigo là bậc thầy khắc họa tâm lý nhân vật, tình huống, rồi dắt chúng ta ngoan ngoãn theo sau. Thật đau đớn, hệt như những lần trước, tôi lại bị lừa.

Cái kết chơi vơi này, chẳng biết tác giả lừa hay do NXB dịch để lừa nhưng đã gieo vô người đọc cái dòng chữ SAYONARA với cách hiểu tiêu cực là vĩnh biệt. Gấp cuốn sách lại, tôi gần như suy sụp, hụt hững, shock nặng vì cái kết. Sau đó, vì không cam lòng, nên đã đọc đi đọc lại đoạn kết, phân tích hết cả những lần đã trải nghiệm đi cáp treo ở Vinpearl, Bà Nà HILL, Đà Lạt… rồi cười một mình sung sướng. Xưa, tôi cười rất tự nhiên, từ ngày lọt hố Keigo, tôi hay TỰ NHIÊN cười.

review_4301424649,Le Huong,"Oct 22, 2021","** spoiler alert ** Thực sự đọc xong cuốn này mình thấy cũng không đọng lại được nhiều thứ. Vè nội dung thì cơ bản đây là những câu chuyện về tình yêu của những con người tưởng chừng xa lạ nhưng lại được liên kết chặt chẽ bởi một khu trượt tuyết . Nhưng tình yêu ở truyện không màu hồng mà có phần tăm tối, trần trụi hơn, trong đó có cả chuyện ngoại tình. Có vẻ ngoại tình ở đây khá bình thường và có thể chấp nhận được, nhưng thực sự với bản thân mình thì KHÔNG nên đến những đoạn đó thì mình lại thấyhơi khó chịu và có phần thắc mắc lối cư xử của các nhân vật (Tại sao thấy tội lỗi nhưng vẫn muốn lên giường với cô bạn gái mới trước khi kết hôn để rồi làm khổ cả 2 người con gái?; Tại sao bị phản bội mà vẫn dễ dàng tha thứ trong khi đáng lẽ có thể tìm được hạnh phúc mới?; Tại sao nhóm bạn biết anh này đào hoa, thích cặp bồ,..mà vẫn gán ghép 2 anh chị một lễ cầu hôn trong chính ngày anh ta lập kế hoạch định đưa cô gái khác lên giường? Và đặc biệt là hành động túng quẫn của nhân vật cuối truyện, KHÔNG THỂ HIỂU NỔI! sao phải từ bỏ cuộc đời vì một tên bẩn thỉu, đáng khinh,...trong khi chị hoàn toàn có thể tìm cách giải quyết khác và cuối cùng vẫn bên cạnh hạnh phúc với người yêu mới??)
Về hình thức ,thì nói chung dù cốt truyện không gay cấn đặc biệt , nhưng lối dẫn dắt và văn phong của Keigo chưa bao giờ làm mình thấy chán. Nó nhẹ nhàng, chậm rãi nhưng vừa đủ để giữ mình đến cuối truyện.

Chốt lại đây là một cuốn không đến nỗi dở tệ nhưng cũng không để lại cho mình nhiều ấn tượng, suy nghĩ, hay bài học. Mình sẽ không đọc lại và có lẽ cũng sẽ không nhớ nhiều về nó trong tương lại.",3,0 likes,35
review_4425410395,Ges,"Dec 30, 2021","Truyện này đúng ra phải đc xếp vào thể loại ngôn tình mới đúng, nhưng vì là truyện của bác Keigo nên vẫn xin up lên vài dòng....xin nói trc là chỉ có chê và chê thôi, hehe!
Chê thứ nhất: bối cảnh của truyện
Câu chuyện xoay quanh một khu phức hợp nghỉ dưỡng, suối nước nóng và trượt tuyết tên là Satozawa - nơi diễn ra những tình huống bi hài của tất cả những nhân vật trong truyện....cách sắp xếp những mẩu chuyện nhỏ vốn tưởng chừng rời rạc, lại ghép thành 1 bức tranh lớn vốn là 1 trong những sở trường của Keigo sensei, tuy nhiên thì cá nhân mình thấy lần này bác làm hơi khiên cưỡng, khiến cho mình đọc mà cứ thấy gợn gợn, ko thuyết phục!.... có lẽ bởi bối cảnh của truyện hơi hẹp và đơn điệu, và cũng có thể phần nào do mình ko quen đọc thể loại tiểu thuyết diễm tình này lắm, nên mình thấy hơi ảo và phi thực tế....
Chê thứ hai: tuyến nhân vật!
Số lượng nhân vật vốn cũng ko nhiều nhưng ko được khai thác kĩ càng nên ai cũng có cá tính nhàn nhạt, chẳng để lại ấn tượng (với độc giả nữ chắc sẽ có ấn tượng hơn với Kota, Mizuki, Hida )....chưa kể còn đưa ra những nhân vật râu ria xung quanh mà vai trò ko rõ ràng, cũng chẳng có cái kết nào cho họ cả ☹....có vẻ với Cáp treo tình yêu, tác giả định làm mới bản thân hoàn toàn, muốn thử sức ở phong cách khác chăng? Nếu có thế thật thì có lẽ đây là 1 thử nghiệm thất bại!....việc tạo dựng nhân vật kiểu này khiến mình ko nhận ra đây là truyện của Keigo luôn, lỏng lẻo và hời hợt vô cùng!
Chê thứ 3: nội dung, chủ đề và cái kết
Có lẽ khi chắp bút viết, Keigo muốn truyền tải thông điệp: thế giới này trông có vẻ mênh mông, nhưng lại chỉ là khối cầu bé tí....và trong cái khối cầu đó, mỗi con người là 1 mảnh ghép tạo nên thế giới, đều có mối liên kết vô hình với nhau, và ai cũng có 1 nửa nữa cho riêng mình, như những miếng ghép có thể lắp vừa khít với nhau....vấn đề là như khi chơi ghép tranh, ko phải lúc nào ta cũng tìm ngay ra cho mình miếng ghép thích hợp còn thiếu, và chỉ cần nhầm lẫn chút thôi, bức tranh đc tạo thành sẽ rất khác (kiểu kiểu vậy, mình ko giỏi ví von lắm)....thế nhưng cách thể hiện triết lý của tác giả qua câu chuyện ko thực sự rõ ràng và có phần bế tắc, nó tù túng, nó ko thoát đc ý và khiến mình thấy khá nhạt nhẽo khi đọc về cái cách xử lý tình huống tréo ngoe trong truyện....đọc xong chỉ thấy 1 điều: các bạn FA lâu năm chả có lý do gì mà than thở chuyện tình yêu khi ngoài kia vẫn đang còn 1 Hida đang quằn quại với nỗi đau thất tình hết lần này đến lần khác....hay chính ra đểu 1 chút, sở khanh 1 chút có khi lại hay ....
và cuối cùng là cái kết: cái kết ửng lơ và vô duyên vô cùng!.... bạn nào fan Keigo lâu năm, chuyên gia phân tích truyện của Keigo giải thích cho mình dụng ý của đoạn kết với? Mình chịu đấy!

Tóm lại, cá nhân mình đánh giá đây là 1 tiểu thuyết dở của Keigo, là 1 bước thụt lùi trong phong cách của nhà văn người Nhật!

Các tình tiết thì khá rời rạc, tuy là truyện tình cảm nhưng lại không cho thấy sự lãng mạn nhiều. Tuy nhiên đọc đến giữa sách thì mình vô cùng bất ngờ, vì giữa những câu truyện tưởng như rời rạc ấy lại có một sự liên kết đáng nhạc nhiên. Tất cả các nhân vật đều dính líu đến nhau, và các câu chuyện của họ cũng vậy. Thành thử ra, đọc xong rồi mình vẫn phải tẩn ngẩn ngồi sắp xếp lại các sự việc và nhân vật để xem mối quan hệ giữa họ. Cách kể truyện rất logic, rất liên quan và rất Higashino Keigo.

🚠 Tuy nhiên, mình vẫn chưa ưng cuốn này lắm, vì dù có sự liên kết thật đấy, nhưng cái duyên, cái tình cờ rất không ngờ ấy lại khiến mình thấy hơi sượng trân. Nữa là cái kiểu cứ giới thiệu đi giới thiệu lại nhân vật làm mình khó chịu. Và dù cái cách xử lý tình huống của tác giả làm mình gật gù đồng tình, nhưng nó vẫn chưa tới khi so với những tác phẩm sau này.

Câu chuyện làm mình liên tưởng đến C-drama dài tập: Một nhóm nhân vật và những chuyện tình cảm rối rắm đan xen.
Cái hay là tác giả đưa cái kết trở về điểm xuất phát, bởi vậy tác giả đã đặt tên chương cuối là Replay. Mình thích điều này khi câu chuyện được bo tròn một cách khéo léo.
Ngoài ra thì cuốn sách còn truyền tải 1 thông điệp xã hội nữa là việc kết hôn trước 30 tuổi. Xem ra không chỉ có người trẻ VN mà Nhật Bản cũng khá đau đầu về vấn đề này. Nhưng mình xin phép trích dẫn 1 câu mình mới đọc đc trong 1 cuốn sách gần đây: đừng kết hôn khi mọi tế bào trong cơ thể bạn không sẵn sàng cho điều đó.
Sai lầm thường hay bắt nguồn từ sự vội vàng. Nước đến chân mới nhảy thì hay nhảy nhầm vũng bùn lắm. Vẫn là nên học bơi phải khum mọi người 😅
Cuốn thứ 2 đọc của bác về đề tài trượt tuyết . Có vẻ sensei rất thích môn thể thao này.
⚠️ SPOILER
Mình đã suy nghĩ rất nhiều về cái kết. Đó là một cái kết mở để người đọc tùy ý lựa chọn số phận của nhận vật. Thế nhưng dù kết thế nào thì mũi dao vẫn chĩa về phía nạn nhân. Và mình thực sự không thích điều đó. Đây là một cái kết khiên cưỡng, có phần bức tử nhân vật. Những con người được xây dựng trong tác phẩm đều ngấp nghé 30 tuổi, đủ trí tuệ và bản lĩnh để đối mặt với những tai ương của cuộc sống mà không cần đánh mất phẩm giá. Tuổi 30 đâu phải là án tử phải không nào?
Thế nên mình hy vọng một cái kết khác nhân văn hơn, kẻ không xứng đang sẽ phải bẽ mặt còn người vô tình bị cuốn vào rối rắm sẽ gỡ được mình ra khỏi mớ bòng bong. Đâu phải cứ tác giả truyện trinh thám thì không thể viết được kịch bản phim truyền hình phải không? 😅",2,0 likes,35

Mình nghĩ đây lại là 1 tác phẩm ghi dấu sự thử nghiệm mới của Keigo Higasgino về phong cách và cốt truyện, khi mà nội dung không phải thể loại trinh thám như thường lệ. Nếu như quyển “Điều kỳ diệu ở tiệm tạp hoá Namiya” rất dễ thương với những điều kỳ diệu và cảm động giữa 1 nhóm bạn trẻ và người chủ tiệm ngày xưa, thì truyện này lại theo thể loại tình cảm hẳn với sự nhẹ nhàng nhưng không kém phần kịch tính với nhiều diễn biến bất ngờ. Tuy vậy, mình không nghĩ quyển này là 1 truyện hay của Keigo Higashino vì văn phong đôi khi lê thê và dài dòng, tâm lý nhân vật khá mờ nhạt.

Dù biết trước đây không phải trinh thám, nhưng vẫn có chút mong chờ vì từng ấn tượng tài năng của tác giả từ hồi Namiya. Với mình quyển này không đặc sắc, lúc đọc còn có cảm giác như khu trượt tuyết ở Satozawa đặt hàng tác giả viết cuốn này vậy, tả cảnh với khen dịch vụ hơi nhiều. Cốt truyện mình thấy hơi thường so với mặt bằng fiction chung, chứ nếu so với các cốt truyện khác mà bác Keigo từng viết thì quyển này còn kém rấttttt xa. Mấy nhân vật nam chủ chốt của câu chuyện kiểu cách cứ hạ tiện thế nào, bắt cá hai tay đến lúc vỡ lở thì đặt điều khổ thân tôi bị hại, rồi lại nói xấu đồng nghiệp nữ, nịnh nọt, có ông thì lại khù khờ một cách vô lý (lúc gặp khách hàng thì EQ siêu cao @@)... mình chỉ ấn tượng mỗi Nezu nhân viên của khu trượt tuyết (lại nghĩ khu trượt tuyết này có book bác già quảng cáo không mà từ cảnh quang đến phục vụ đều tốt hết sức LOL).

ความดีงามของเคย์โงะอีกอย่างคือการสร้างคาแรคเตอร์ ความเป็นธรรมชาติของตัวละคร หลายครั้งที่เราก็เผลอเอาใจช่วยฆาตกร เหมือนที่พูดกันว่า ""นายมันตัวร้ายนะฮันนิน แต่ฉันเกลียดนายไม่ลงว่ะ"" เรื่องนี้ผมก็เกลียดเจ้าทากาชิไม่ลง แม้จะรู้ว่าหมอนี่ทำอะไรกับความไว้วางใจที่เพื่อนมีให้บ้าง เพื่อนไปหาปรึกษาถึงห้อง พูดให้ฟังดีๆ ก็แล้ว มันยังมีหน้าดอดไปบอกแฟนเค้า ""รู้ไหมผมคิดอะไรอยู่ / ยิ้ม ผมอยากให้ความรักของพวกคุณพังทลายลง .. ผมเป็นผู้ชายแบบนี้แหละ"" ดูเผินๆ ทากาชิเป็นคนน่ารังเกียจ มันก็รู้ และมันก็เกลียดตัวเอง แต่อ่านแล้วก็เข้าใจมันนะ เข้าใจมากด้วย เป็นเล่มที่ความคิดของตัวละครทำเราหยุดชะงักเหมือนกัน

เสียดายแค่ตอนท้าย ที่เรื่องรวบรัดไปมาก จากที่บิ้วกันมาแต่ต้นเลยดูอ่อนไป แต่อย่างไรก็ตาม ยังเป็นเล่มที่อ่านสนุกมาก และเปลี่ยนอารมณ์จากงานฆาตกรรมอำพรางมาเป็นตามไขปริศนาได้ไม่เลวเลยทีเดียว ถ้ามีโอกาสก็ลองอ่านดูนะครับ",3,7 likes,36

สนุกตราตรึง ราวกับ The Inception เวอร์ชั่น Keigo

นิยายสืบสวนสอบสวนที่มีส่วนผสมอันลงตัวมากๆ ของดราม่าและ sci-fi ตามแบบฉบับมหาเทพ Keigo เล่มนี้สนุกจริงๆ

เรื่องราวความรัก ดราม่าความผูกพัน และมิตรภาพระหว่างเพื่อนที่เข้นข้นของนักวิจัยหนุ่มผู้ศึกษาวิจัยเกี่ยวกับการทำงานของสมองและจินตนาการ
โดยเล่าเรื่องผ่านความทรงจำที่เป็นคู่ขนาน
ในโลกหนึ่ง เขากำลังจะแย่งคนรักจากเพื่อนสนิท เพราะเธอคือรักแรกพบ ที่เขายอมที่จะทำทุกสิ่งอย่าง แม้กระทั่งทำลายมิตรภาพระหว่างเพื่อนที่รักกันมากลงได้
ในอีกโลกหนึ่ง เขากำลังมีความสุขกับคนรักคนเดียวกันที่เพื่อนสนิทคนนั้นเป็นผู้แนะนำให้รู้จัก แต่เพื่อนคนนั้นกลับหายไปอย่างไร้ร่องรอย ไม่รู้สภาพว่าเป็นตายร้ายดียังไง

โลกไหนคือโลกความจริง?

มันสนุกชวนติดตามมากKeigo เขียนเล่มนี้ในปี 1998 แต่ใส่พลังจินตนาการเรื่องวิทยาศาสตร์ของความทรงจำไว้เต็มเปี่ยม
เราจะสามารถเปลี่ยนความทรงจำได้หรือ และปัญหาของความทรงจำอื่นๆ ที่ขัดแย้งกับความทรงจำที่ปลูกเข้าไปใหม่ล่ะจะแก้ได้ยังไง
พล็อตเรื่องนี่ sci-fi มาก แต่กลับเอาดราม่าความสัมพันธ์ที่งวดข้นเอามาใส่ได้อย่างลงตัว ปรุงแต่งด้วยกลิ่นอายของการสืบสวนสอบสวนจนออกมายอดเยี่ยม

Keigo ทำการบ้านเรื่องความทรงจำได้ดีมาก ที่ชอบเลย คือการอธิบายให้เข้าใจถึงประกฏการณ์หลงผิด สร้างความทรงจำขึ้นมาใหม่ของคนเราได้ด้วยภาษาไม่ซับซ้อน เห็นภาพเลยว่าความทรงจำแบบหลงผิดของคนเรานั้นมันเกิดขึ้นได้โดยที่ผู้ที่หลงผิดเชื่ออย่างบริสุทธิ์ใจได้จริงๆ

นอกจากนี้ เช่นเคย Keigo ยังคงความเทพในเรื่องของดราม่าความสัมพันธ์ ที่เขียนขึ้นมาให้บีบคั้นมโนธรรมสำนึกของคนอ่านได้ดีมาก

ท้ายที่สุด ยังทิ้งคำถามไว้ให้กับคนอ่านมากมาย รวมทั้งประเด็นอันละเอียดอ่อนอย่างการลบทิ้งความทรงจำอันขมขื่น
แน่นอนว่ามันน่าจะมีประโยชน์กับหลายกรณี
แต่ความทรงจำก็เป็นทั้ง property และ identity ของคนมิใช่หรือ
เมื่อลบหรือเปลี่ยนไป เราจะยังเป็นคนเดิมอยู่อีกหรือเปล่า?",5,6 likes,36

'ทากาชิ' หลงรักหญิงสาวคนหนึ่ง เธอเป็นผู้โดยสารรถไฟสายคู่ขนานกับสายที่เขาขึ้นเป็นประจำ แต่เขาเพิ่งมารู้ในภายหลังว่าหญิงคนนั้นคือ 'มายุโกะ' แฟนสาวของ 'โทโมฮิโกะ' เพื่อนคนสนิทของเขาเอง ทว่าวันหนึ่ง ทากาชิลืมตาขึ้นมาอีกครั้ง กลับพบว่า มายุโกะเป็นคนรักของเขา ส่วนโทโมฮิโกะก็ย้ายไปทำงานต่อที่ต่างประเทศแทน สถานการณ์ทุกอย่างเหมือนจะไม่มีอะไร แต่มันผิดปกติ และนั่นคือจุดเริ่มต้นของการค้นหาความจริงของทากาชิ

เราชอบพล็อตเรื่องแนวนี้ แนวที่เล่นกับความทรงจำของคน แนวที่ไม่รู้ว่าอะไรคือความจริงกันแน่ มันชวนสับสนชวนวุ่นวาย แลดูลุ้นๆ แบบงงๆ ดี 5555

ถ้าจะพูดว่ามันคือ Inception เวอร์ชั่นโรมานซ์ ก็ไม่ผิดทีเดียวหรอก เป็นแนวโรมานซ์ไซไฟ มีความเป็นวิทยาศาสตร์มากกว่าแฟนตาซี มีกลิ่นอายความลึบลับสืบสวนอยู่ประปราย

มีหลายจุดในเรื่องที่เรารู้สึกว่า ถ้าสะกิดใจ ถ้าเอะใจสักนิด นั่นคือเราเดินมาถึงจุดเฉลยเรื่องได้แล้ว ขาดแต่เพียงมูลเหตุจูงใจ หรือจิ๊กซอว์เหตุการณ์บางส่วนที่ทำให้เหตุและผลของการกระทำตัวละครมาบรรจบกันพอดีอย่างสมบูรณ์แบบ

ตอนแรกที่อ่านคำนำของผู้แปล ผู้แปลบอกว่า มีหลายคนอ่านเรื่องนี้แล้วสับสน เราก็ชักหวั่นๆ ว่า เรื่องนี้จะสับสนเกินกว่าจะเข้าใจรึเปล่า แต่ผู้แปลก็บอกทริคเล็กๆ ในการอ่านเล่มนี้ไว้ คือ แยกเหตุการณ์ใน 'บทที่' และ 'ฉากที่' ออกจากกัน แค่นั้นก็คลายความสับสนในโลกผ่านมุมมองของทากาชิไประดับหนึ่งเลย 5555

สรุปคือ ชอบค่ะ ปวดใจในความสัมพันธ์รักสามเศร้าของสามตัวละครหลักดี เนื้อเรื่องก็ดูลึกลับน่าค้นหา แต่เพราะเราชอบแนวนี้และตามเสพมาหลายงานที่พล็อตทำนองนี้ล่ะมั้ง ความตื่นเต้นในการค้นหาความจริงเลยแผ่วๆ ลง แต่ไปมุ่งเน้นที่ความรู้สึกของทากาชิเสียมากกว่าว่าจะไปจบที่ตรงไหน",3,,36

เรื่องนี้ ส่วนผสมของความไซไฟ และ รักสามเศร้า
ส่วนตัวคิดว่า ฝั่งไซไฟ ของเล่มนี้ สำหรับคนอ่าน แนวไซไฟ เพียวๆ มาเยอะ อาจจะไม่ถูกใจมากนัก แต่กลับกลายเป็นว่า พาร์ท ที่ Higashino Keigo ทำได้ดี(อีกแล้ว)คือพาร์ทสำรวจลึกไปถึงข้างในจิตใจ ของตัวละครเช่นเคย
ถึงแม้ว่าตอนนี้ มันจะรวบรัด ให้พระเอก ชอบหญิงสาว เร็วไปหน่อย เหตุผลน้อยไปนิดสำหรับผม

.
เรื่องราวเกี่ยวกับชีวิตของ พระเอก ‘ทากาชิ’ ที่แอบหลงรัก ‘มายุโกะ’ หญูิงสาวผู้โดยสารรถไฟสายคู่ขนานกับที่เขาขึ้นเป็นประจำแต่อยู่มาวันหนึ่ง ผู้หญิงคนนี้กลับกลายมาเป็นแฟนสาวกับเพื่อนสนิทของเขา ในยุคสมัยที่เทคโนโลยีกำลังก้าวไกลขึ้นเรื่อยๆ
.
.
พลอตน่าสนใจมากๆ และ คำอธิบายประกอบฝั่งไซไฟ จะอิง จากตัวละครและงานวิจัย ของบริษัทที่ตัวเอกทั้ง 3 ทำงานอยู่ คืองานด้าน วิจัยสมอง การปลูกฝังความทรงจำ neuroscience ต่างๆ
.
.
ด้วยความที่เป็นเรื่องเล่าของคนที่ความทรงจำค่อนข้างจะสับสน จึงต้องตั้งใจ อ่าน เรียง timeline ดีๆ
.
.
ความรู้สึก
- เหมือนเดิมตามสไตล์ ที่ในเรื่องจะ ไม่มีใครดีไม่มีใครเลว และทุกอย่างจะเฉลยตอนจบ ว่าสุดท้ายแล้วมันยังไงกันแน่
- โทนเรื่อง ราบๆเรียบๆ ไปเรื่อยๆ นะเรื่องนี้ แต่โดยรวมสนุก

ถึง ชาวโลกคู่ขนานทุกท่าน

ครั้งแรกที่รู้จักหนังสือเล่มนี้ จากนักแสดงชายญี่ปุ่น ที่เราชื่นชอบ ชื่อ ยูตะ ทามาโมริ เล่นภาพยนตร์เรื่องนี้ และเราพบว่า เป็นการเล่นที่แตกต่างจากที่ยูตะเคยเล่นมาหลายเรื่อง และเรื่องนี้ ยิ่งดูยิ่งตื่นเต้น ระทึกขวัญ ดำดิ่งไปในโลกเทาๆสีหม่นๆและนักแสดงทุกคนเล่นเก่งมาก ทำให้เรามีแต่คำถามว่า ""อะไร อะไร"" จนกระทั่งดูจนจบ (ตอนจบของหนังไม่เหมือนในหนังสือ ตอนจบของหนังจะสุขนิยมกว่า แต่ตอนจบของหนังสือ ให้เราคิดเองต่อได้)


หลังดูจบ เราก็มาค้นหาจนเจอว่า มีหนังสือด้วย แถมคนเขียน คือ คนที่เราชอบสุดกระดิ่งแมว นั้นก็คือ ฮิงาชิโนะ เคโงะดังนั้น ""อยากได้สุดๆขึ้นมา"" เราไปบอกพี่สาว พี่สาวไปสั่งร้านนายอินทร์มาให้

แล้วเป็นหนังสือที่รอนานมากๆ รอตั้งสองอาทิตย์ หนังสือก็มาอยู่ในมือของเรา

เมื่อหนังสือมาอยู่ในมือเรา เราก็รู้แล้วว่า ความสนุก ตื่นเต้น ระทึกขวัญ โลกเทาๆ รอเราอยู่


เรื่องเริ่มในหนังสือกับในหนังเหมือกันหมด แต่การเล่าเรื่องในหนังสือ ทำให้เราจินตนการได้ไกลกว่าในหนัง แต่จุดต่างกันสุดๆ คือ ตอนจบ (มาเฉลยทีหลัง เรื่องนี้ขอเปิดเผยเนื้อหาสำคัญ)

ก่อนอ่านต้องบอกว่า เรื่องนี้สำคัญ เพราะหลายคนอ่านไม่รู้ พาลไม่ชอบหนังสือเล่มนี้ด้วย คือ ทุกคนต้องอ่านคำนำผู้แปลอย่างคุณบัณฑิต จะอ่านสนุกขึ้นและเข้าใจมากขึ้น ว่า เรากำลังอ่านส่วนไหนอยู่


เริ่มเรื่องว่า พระเอกของเรื่อง (ทากาชิ) ตกหลุมรัก นางเอก (มายุโกะ) ในขณะที่นั่งรถไฟสวนกัน ซึ่งขณะรถไฟสวนกันทากาชิจะเห็นมายุโกะ แล้ววันนึง ทากาชิตัดสินใจนั่งรถไฟขบวนของมายุโกะ พอรถไฟกำลังแล่นออกไป ทากาชิเห็นมายุโกะอยู่ในรถไฟขบวนที่ตัวเองโดยสารประจำ ทำให้ทากาชิลงรถไฟขบวนถัดไป และรีบไปค้นหามายุโกะแต่ไม่เจอและแล้ว ทากาชิมารู้ทีหลังว่า มายุโกะเป็นแฟนกับเพื่อนสนิท คือ โทโมฮิโกะ ทากาชิพยายามที่จะลืมมายุโกะ แต่ทำไม่สำเร็จ ดันพอเริ่มที่จะสนิทกับมายุโกะมากขึ้น ก็ทำให้ทากาชิอยากได้มายุโกะเป็นเจ้าของมากขึ้น


ทุกอย่างตัดไป

เมื่อทากาชิตื่นขึ้นมา ทากาชิเป็นแฟนกับมายุโกะ ส่วนโทโมฮิโกะหายไป ไปอเมริกาแทน

แต่เมื่อลืมตาอีกครั้ง
มายุโกะเป็นแฟนกับโทโมฮิโกะ และทากาชิเอ่ยรักมายุโกะต่อไป

เรื่องเริ่มแปลกขึ้นเรื่อยๆ เมื่อทุกครั้งที่ลืมตา จะเป็นอีกเหตุการณ์นึง แต่เมื่อลืมตาอีกครั้งก็จะเป็นอีกเหตุการณ์นึง

พอยิ่งค้นหาไปเรื่อยๆ ก็ได้เจอกับความมืดมิดที่ทากาชิทำผิดพลาดไปแล้ว ทากาชิลืมแม้กระทั่งความเป็นเพื่อนสนิทกับโทโมฮิโกะ มีแต่เพียงอย่างเดียวในใจตอนนี้คือ มายุโกะเท่านั้นที่ต้องเป็นของเขา

เรื่องก็ดำเนินมาถึง

โทโมฮิโกะตัดสินใจที่จะรักษามิตรภาพของทากาชิไว้ โดยการเสียสละมายุโกะให้ทากาชิตลอดไป

โลกคู่ขนานจึงเกิดขึ้น เพราะโครงการการปรับเปลี่ยนความคิด ทำให้ทากาชิมาอยู่ในโลกคู่ขนานที่คิดว่า มายุโกะเป็นแฟนกับทากาชิ เมื่อทากาชิรู้แล้ว ก็ดำเนินเรื่องมาถึงทางเลือก


ตอนจบของหนังสือ
ทากาชิตัดสินใจเข้าโครงการ เพื่อจะเปลี่ยนทุกอย่างให้ถูกต้อง พร้อมกับมายุโกะ และจะมีคำเขียนติดตาว่า
ทากาชิ: ""ผมมันคนอ่อนเเอ""
มายุโกะ: ""ฉันก็คนอ่อนแอเหมือนกัน""
*** ความคิดเห็นส่วนตัว คือ ทั้งคู่อ่อนแอจริงๆ โทโมฮิโกะก็อ่อนแอเหมือนกัน เพราะไม่รู้จะเลือกทางไหน นั้นก็เพื่อนสนิท นี่ก็คนที่เขารัก เขาควรทำไง คิดว่า ถ้าจบชีวิตตัวเองด้วยเพื่อนที่สนิทดีกว่า ***

ตอนจบของภาพยนตร์
ทากาชิตัดสินใจเข้าโครงการ เพื่อจะเปลี่ยนทุกอย่างให้ถูกต้อง พร้อมกับมายุโกะ และทากาชิช่วยโทโมฮิโกะสำเร็จโทโมฮิโกะไม่ได้เป็นเเฟนกับมายุโกะแล้ว โทโมฮิโกะกลับมาเป็นเพื่อนสนิทกันเหมือนกัน สุดท้าย ทากาชิมาเจอมายุโกะ จบว่า มองตากันแล้วใจสื่อถึงความรักที่มีให้กัน

พระเอกและนางเอกของเคโงะจะเป็นคนเทา มีทั้งดีทั้งไม่ดี และเคโงะสามารถดำเนินเรื่องในหนังสือให้ถึงความจริงของมนุษย์ได้ (บางครั้ง เราอาจเคยอยากทำอะไรที่มันผิดพลาดได้ เรื่องสามัญสำนึกถึงสำคัญในการดำเนินชีวิต) โหดร้าย และตีแผ่จิตใจมนุษย์ในยามเลือกผิด ผ่านตัวหนังสือได้ดี

ส่วนด้านนักแสดง
1. ยูตะ ทามาโมริ เล่นเป็น ทากาชิ (สามารถเอาอยู่จริงๆ) พระเอกสีเทาๆ ที่ไม่ได้เป็นคนดีอะไร เป็นแต่คนที่จะเอาตัวเองเป็นหลัก แต่ก็ไม่คิดที่อยากจะทำร้ายให้โทโมฮิโกะหายไปจากโลกนี้
2. โชตะ โซเมะตานิ (พระเอกปรสิตเดรัจฉาน) เล่นเป็น โทโมฮิโกะ (เล่นเก่งมาก โดยเฉพาะจะต้องลากเท้า เหมือนคนที่ขามีปัญหาและสามารถเข้าถึงอารมณ์ของตัวละครได้ดี) เป็นคนที่จิตใจหม่นๆ รักทั้งเพื่อนทั้งมายุโกะเลยคิดว่า ถ้าตัวเองหายไป น่าจะเป็นการแก้ปัญหาที่ถูกต้องสุด
3. ริโฮ โยชิโอกะ เล่นเป็น มายุโกะ (สามารถเล่นเข้าถึงอารมณ์ของความสับสนได้เป็นอย่างดี) เป็น นางเอกที่สับสนแต่ตั้งใจที่จะอยู่กับความถูกต้องที่สุด

*** หนังสือจบแต่เราต้องกลับมาคิดถึงมิตรภาพที่ดีต่อกันไว้ ***
""ความรักฉันท์หญิงชายก็สำคัญ
แต่กระนั้นมิตรภาพสำคัญกว่า
เราทุกคนควรที่จะโศกา
หากได้รักมาในทางที่ผิดเอย""

""มิตรภาพไม่ได้สร้างแค่วันเดียว""

review_3423494737,Carson,"Jul 03, 2020","My thoughts after finishing this book is that the experience feels lukewarm. It comes, shows occasional promise, then goes.
Our main character Takashi is decidedly a pretty terrible person with a relatable and understandable issue. For a while I considered the book may intentionally be set up to be a character study of someone we were meant to be able to sympathize with to some extent yet ultimately could not agree with.
This book could easily be read under the lens of toxic masculinity or just toxicity in general, but given this was written in 1995, I doubt that’s the case. Instead it feels like at the end we were meant to have wanted to support Takashi, and without giving anything away, I would’ve been on board had certain events not taken place. I’m not angry, just displeased.
The entire book is about Takashi endlessly pining for this girl Mayuko who has no real interesting qualities. She’s just hot and he liked staring at her every morning on the train. There isn’t really one character who I felt attached to, they’re all a little too underdeveloped and underutilized, much like the scientific concepts presented in the story.
But it’s not like everything is bad here. The story can legitimately be a page turner at points. It sets up some genuinely intriguing mysteries and hints at them quite often. The story is written from two different perspectives that it jumps back and forth from but in both the main character is the same, with a time skip between the two and opposing character behaviors and different pasts. This works to tell the mystery in a way that keeps you guessing how the two perspectives are related, hence the “parallel world” theme. The utilization of this writing method along with the organization of events can make this an interesting read at times. The only issue is that the eventual conclusion to this tale is not as interesting as some of the events that precede it.
In conclusion, it has its moments, but for a story named “Parallel World Love Story,” the love story is whatever and the sci-fi plot leads to a lukewarm finish.

This book is more than just a love story. It’s a love story and friendship mixed with a sci-fi mystery.

Takashi, one day sees a girl on train and immediately falls in love but only to realize she’s a girlfriend of his lifelong best friend, Tomohiko. He struggles with his growing feelings for her and try to forget her to protect their friendship. However, weird thing happen. One day, he wakes up to a world where she’s actually his girlfriend. He becomes confused to which is part is the reality and which ones not. He goes out in search of truth and what actually happened between his best friend and the girl...

I could not believe this book was written in the 90’s. It was easy to read and get into. I loved the concept/plot, however I felt that some part could be a bit shorter. (that could just be me) The author unwraps the mystery little by little to a “grand finale” and I absolutely loved it. It touched me emotionally at some part and I’d definitely recommend to read this book.

Yes, the book focuses on the romantic/friendly relationship between the 3 main characters, the sci-fi-esque premise makes the mystery aspect of the plot much more deep, intense, and multi-dimensional. The book not only explores the fragility of human relationships (friendship and romance alike), but also explores the mysterious workings of human memory.

I love how everything tied together. Although the novel does read like a normal romance novel with all those ugliness of jealousy, self-pity etc. being laid out in the sun, it also has that extra theme of memory being unreliable.

review_3091060967,Chris,"Dec 18, 2019",Really like the variety of ways in which the author presented each story even with the limitation of a setting in schools and the fact that the main character is a relief teacher. I particularly like the educational conclusion or philosophical take of the author presented through the author at the end of each story. Very entertaining and thought-provoking read. 非常喜欢东野圭吾呈现每一个故事的写作手法。虽然故事都围绕着校园的背景发展，但每一个故事的案情的发生、发展和结局都很不同。你不能不赞叹东野先生的创意能力。我特别喜欢他在每一个故事的结尾，通过主角所表到的有教育意义的看法或哲理。值得阅读和发人深思的作品。,5,0 likes,37

แต่มันเป็นเล่มต่อ เพราะฉะนั้นเหตุการณ์จะต่อเนื่องและคู่ขนานไปกับเล่มแรก เหมือนช่วยเติมเต็มเล่มแรกด้วย เพราะฉะนั้นต้องอ่านเล่มแรกก่อนนะ

เล่มนี้แบ่งเป็นห้าตอน ตัวละครหลักคือ ‘มาโดกะ’ เด็กสาวพลังพิเศษที่มีสัญชาตญาณการคาดเดาดินฟ้าอากาศ และ ‘นายูตะ’ ชายหนุ่มนักฝังเข็ม

แต่ละตอนจะเกี่ยวข้องกับการใช้ความสามารถของมายูกะช่วยเหลือคนอื่นคลี่คลายปมในใจ เช่น ช่วยให้นักสกีจั๊มป์ได้แชมป์ ช่วยครอบครัวหนึ่งให้พ้นจากความรู้สึกผิด และช่วยนายูตะหลุดพ้นจากปมในอดีต

ตอนอ่านเล่มแรกเรารู้สึกว่ามาโดกะดูเย็นชา ไม่สุงสิงใคร เข้าถึงยาก แต่พออ่านเล่มนี้เราชอบมาโดกะมากขึ้น คือนางก็มีน้ำใจในแบบของนาง แต่จะเป็นคนพูดตรงๆไม่อ้อมค้อม อาจจะดูขวานผ่าซากหน่อย ก็ด้วยความอัจฉริยะของเธอนั่นแหละ เลยไม่อยากพูดให้มากความ เช่น “ฉันว่าไม่เห็นจำเป็นต้องใส่ใจนักกีฬาที่มือตกเลย ในเมื่อเป็นมืออาชีพก็ควรลุกขึ้นมายืนหยัดด้วยตัวเองให้ได้สิ ถ้าทำไม่ได้ก็ต้องเลิกเล่นเท่านั้นแหละ” ฟังจบ หงายหลังตึง!!!

review_4408881681,Phu,"Dec 28, 2021","Koru Shirakawa, người được xem là một thần đồng. Từ khi được sinh ra, Koru luôn là ""điểm sáng"" trong mắt mọi người, từ nhỏ Koru đã có thể học và hiểu những kiến thức mà những đứa trẻ cùng tuổi với cậu bé còn chưa thể biết, kể cả khi trưởng thành thì trí thông minh của Koru càng nổi trội.
Koru có sở thích với hội họa, đặc biệt hơn là cậu có thể phân biệt được những màu sắc một cách chi tiết mà người thường không thể.
Rồi một ngày, Koru chế tạo ra một cỗ máy có thể tạo ra thứ ánh sáng mang những màu sắc kỳ diệu.

Câu chuyện xen kẽ với những góc nhìn của các nhân vật khác Koichi Soma, Masashi Shino, Terumi Kozuki,..v.v họ là những con người có những áp lực, họ mê mẫn thứ ánh sáng do Koru tạo ra, thứ ""ánh sáng"" đó xua tan đi áp lực của họ. Dần dần thứ ""ánh sáng"" đó như một loại ma túy và càng ngày có nhiều người muốn được nhìn thấy nó.

Ban đầu, mình nghĩ câu chuyện sẽ nói về những mâu thuận giữa cha mẹ và con cái, bởi điều đó ban đầu được viết rất ổn. Nhưng sau đó thì mọi thứ chuyển sang phản ánh về bản chất con người - những kẻ muốn dùng ""ánh sáng"" để trục lợi cho bản thân bọn chúng.

Những nhân vật ban đầu được xây dựng khiến mình đồng cảm với họ, nhưng càng về sau điều đó lại mất đi. Theo mình nhân vật được xây dựng ổn ngoài Koru, là Terumi - từ hoàn cảnh và cách ""ánh sáng"" thay đổi cô ấy, điểm khác mình thích ở Terumi là khoảnh khắc cô phát hiện ra người cô ấy thích đã yêu một người khác, nhưng Terumi vẫn muốn chúc cho họ hạnh phúc.

Không phải câu chuyện về điều tra phá án, thay vào đó tác giả lồng ghép vào đó những triết lí về con người, những thông tin khoa học - kỹ thuật.
Mình chắc đây là một câu chuyện sáng tạo,
đôi khi có những phân đoạn hồi hộp. Nhưng càng đọc mình cảm thấy mọi thứ càng xuống dốc và có những chi tiết lan man dài dòng, có rất nhiều điều bị bỏ ngỏ và cái kết quá nhanh.",3,5 likes,39

review_2377136119,Cathy,"Jun 19, 2018",東野圭吾的徬徨之刃。書的一開始就是兩個不良少年襲擊路過少女加以迷姦的駭人場面，迷姦致死之後又加以棄屍（嚇死人....我如果事先知道是這個主題可能就不會選這本書來看了....)。這兩個不良少年真的是毫無悔意，沒有一點令人同情之處。劇情接著就著重在少女的父親要找這兩位不良少年報仇，殺了其中一位，接著帶著獵槍追殺逃亡的第二位...。警方一方面要逮捕逃亡的第二位少年，另一方面也要逮捕已成為殺人犯的父親。閱讀的過程當中會不由自主地為父親加油，想知道父親有沒有成功，想一直看下去。其實從父親殺死第一位少年的報仇行動的描寫就可以看出來，報仇成功也是很空虛的，對方死了家屬的悔恨也沒有減少。但是就這樣放任第二位少年因未成年的關係從輕量刑，還是怎麼樣都無法釋懷，因為相對於他暴虐的行為，這樣的輕罰太不公平了，作者也從很多角色的視角來描寫說，其實大家都覺得不公義，不管是受害者家屬、警察、看新聞的社會大眾....。總之這本書對不良少年的描寫是非常負面的，幾乎可說是「惡」的化身，或者起碼是令人無法理解的存在。我覺得前半段的鋪陳和劇情展開都很好，前面的發展緩慢、很多細節，但是相對而言，最後的結局時間卻突然快進，讀的時候覺得突兀。,5,0 likes,40

A strong social commentary background that also attempts to highlight the unhealthy influence of the unscrupulous mass media and how wealth could attempt to bend the law, expositing the undertones of youth violence FIRST highlighted in Malice (Akui) - this is sort of an unofficial complement to Shunji Iwai's ""All About Lily Chou-Chou"".

Some of the description might make the reader uncomfortable (similar language in Byakuyakou), but it does bring the harsh reality with the force of a hammer - to not stop to think and confront the reality presented is unfathomable.

To the end, the tense pacing sort of took a hit with some typical Japanese melodrama, but the twist near the end was a gem.",5,0 likes,40

Shigeki Nagamine, người đàn ông phát hiện cô con gái duy nhất mà ông hết mực yêu thương đã chết. Nagamine sau đó biết được, con gái ông ấy đã bị một nhóm thanh thiếu niên bắt cóc và cưỡng hiếp, sau đó bọn chúng giết và vứt xác cô bé. Lần theo những manh mối có được và với sự căm thù trong lòng, ông Nagamine bắt đầu hành trình báo thù cho cô con gái.

""Ông ấy rơi nước mắt. Khi ông ấy nghĩ đến di vật vợ ông ấy để lại, con gái ông, người mà ông luôn coi trọng hơn cả mạng sống, báu vật duy nhất trên thế giới, lại bị tàn phá bởi loại cặn bã chỉ có thể gọi là cầm thú, ông gần như muốn phát điên.""


Với một phần mở đầu ""bùng nổ"" thì cuốn sách có sự hồi hộp ngay từ những phần đầu. Mình chìm đắm trong những cảm xúc của ông Nagamine - đau khổ, tức giận, biết bao nhiêu căm hận bên trong ông ấy; kể cả những thứ mà ông ấy phát hiện thật khó để những người cha người mẹ chấp nhận được. Ông Nagamine phải đấu tranh tư tưởng giữa thiện và ác bên trong ông ấy.



Điều đáng chú ý được đặt ra trong cuốn sách, Pháp luật có công bằng không? Vấn đề Pháp luật về tội phạm vị thành niên luôn nhức nhối. Khi câu chuyện của ông Nagamine được báo chí tung ra - nó đã gây ra tranh cãi và dư luận chia thành hai phe - ủng hộ hoặc không ủng hộ cách báo thù của ông Nagamine.

Với mở đầu hấp dẫn và tình tiết dẫn đến ""báo thù"" khó đoán, những nhân vật phụ cũng nêu ra những khía cạnh khác nhau từ câu chuyện của họ. Tuy nhiên là càng về sau, các tuyến nhân vật càng chồng chéo nhau và nêu ra quá nhiều vấn đề không được giải quyết triệt để. Các tình tiết kéo dài làm mình mất hứng thú, mình chỉ còn mong mỏi màn báo thù của ông Nagamine.



Một cuốn sách với chủ đề đáng mong đợi, nhưng lại không thỏa mãn hết sự kỳ vọng của mình, mình cảm thấy ""đầu voi đuôi chuột"". Rốt cuộc người đặt ra câu hỏi ""Pháp luật có công bằng không?"" là một người khác :)) Đọc đến cái kết thì mình nghĩ tới một bộ phim của Hàn quốc Don't cry mommy(2012) - nội dung như cuốn sách này chỉ khác người báo thù là người mẹ.

雖然最後長峰沒有復仇成功，反而被正義化身的警察所殺，但是其實一直給長峰密報讓他可以去實施復仇的居然是警察局內部的高層！少年法可以保護少年，但是居然被濫用，當作未成年以前可以任意犯罪的溫床，實在是讓身為執法人員的警察，不勝唏噓。
這本書雖然沒有太多的劇情起伏，但是描寫的非常真實，真的讓人有身歷其境之感。尤其是身為父母真的很能感受長峰的悲痛與憤怒，希望身旁的人與自己都不會遇到這種殘酷的事。",4,0 likes,40

Cuốn sách hiếm hoi của Keigo không có yếu tố trinh thám, mà tập trung vào các mối quan hệ, đặc biệt là góc nhìn và tình trạng hôn nhân của những thanh niên tuổi 30 của Nhật Bản.

Mình thích văn phong của Keigo, vừa đủ nhẹ nhàng, vừa đủ hấp dẫn và khiến có cảm xúc trong trải nghiệm đọc.

Câu chuyện không xuất sắc, thông điệp không ấn tượng là điểm trừ lớn. Nhưng đây cũng là cơ hội để nhìn thấy một góc khác trong cách viết của Keigo.

review_3008690094,Chi – cuddle.thereader,"Mar 24, 2020","Đã lâu lắm rồi từ ngày đọc ‘Điều kì diệu của tiệm tạp hoá Namiya’, tớ mới lại được đọc một cuốn văn phong nhẹ nhàng ẩn chứa những liên kết bất ngờ nữa của Keigo. Đừng mặc định sách của Keigo đều là trinh thám nhé anh em, vì tớ thấy thật ra phần lớn sẽ thiên tâm lý đó 🤩
Mỗi câu chuyện, Keigo đều chọn một chủ đề và cuốn người đọc vào những tình huống tiến thoái lưỡng nan, làm ta băn khoăn không biết phải làm thế nào và thấy ái ngại cho nhân vật. Lần này, chủ đề mà Keigo hướng tới là tình yêu cùng sự phản bội, và tất nhiên là các nhân vật lại tiếp tục quay cuồng trong những khoảnh khắc ‘người tính không bằng trời tính’.

‘Cáp treo tình yêu’ được chia làm nhiều mẩu truyện nhỏ, với hệ thống nhân vật xuất hiện đan xen và có thể khiến chúng ta nghĩ cuộc đời họ sẽ chẳng liên quan tới nhau nữa. Rồi tới những chương cuối, họ bỗng được tác giả đưa lại gần nhau, tớ cảm giác trái đất thật nhỏ bé và những người có duyên nợ lại va phải nhau vậy. Có những đoạn mạch hơi chậm, khiến nhớ lại hồi đọc ‘Trứng chim cúc cu này thuộc về ai’ vậy đó, nhưng màu sắc của ‘Cáp treo tình yêu’ rất tươi sáng nên không làm cho câu chuyện bị trầm buồn.

Cuốn này cũng có 1 cái kết khiến tớ rất bất ngờ, kiểu mọi thứ đang bình thường thì rẽ ngoặt cua gấp luôn ngay trang cuối 😂 Lúc đọc xong đi mò mẫm xem mọi người nghĩ sao về cái kết thì hoá ra mỗi người lại có lí giải riêng, thú vị lắm nhưng thôi Chi không spoil đâuuu 🥳 Anh em hãy đọc và khám phá nhé 🥳
Bonus bìa xinh xẻo từ chị Tamypu nữa awwwwwwwww 🥬🥬🥬

Chung lại thì đây là một cuốn khá dễ đọc, vui tươi và nhẹ nhàng nhưng không thiếu đi sự bất ngờ đặc trưng trong cách viết của tác giả, khá đáng thử đó anh em 🥳",4,12 likes,41

Quyển này mà dựng thành phim thì vui phải biết, vì xoay qua xoay lại, xoay trái xoay phải, bấy nhiêu chàng trai cô gái đó vẫn cứ đụng mặt nhau cùng hàng loạt tình huống dở khóc dở cười ở khu trượt tuyết nghỉ dưỡng Satozawa. Lúc đang đọc còn nghĩ có khi quyển này Keigo viết để PR cho khu nghỉ dưỡng đó cũng nên :))

Thấy nhiều bạn bảo thất vọng này nọ nhưng đọc những quyển khác biệt như này của Keigo mình lại rất thích. Nó chứng tỏ khả năng sáng tạo và sức viết phong phú, luôn tìm tòi làm mới chứ không lặp lại chính mình của ông. Mà sách của Keigo còn ra ở VN dài dài nên cứ chuẩn bị tinh thần và cả túi xiền để theo chân sensei thôi.",3,5 likes,41

It was very interesting to see his way of telling romantic stories. Some people are just born to be story tellers and Keigo Higashino is definitely one of them.

예상했던 대로 로맨스를 특유의 스타일로 풀어가며 세상에서 제일 오래된 사람사이의 미스테리인 사랑의 관계를 재미있게 진부하지 않게 감동과 함께 풀어나간다. 단편집이긴 하지만 사람과 사람의 관계를 서로 떡처럼 쫀득하게 엮어서 마지막 페이지를 읽은 후 서로와의 관계로 큰 그림이 그려지는 책이었다. 특히나 눈과 산, 스노우보딩으로 더 특별한 상황을 만들어 더 큰 흥미가 생겼고 예를 들어 첫번째 단편부터 모모미의 고타의 이야기도 스노우보딩의 특별한 세팅이 없었다면 애초에 아찔함과 재미가 없었지 않았을까. 하여간 모든 요소가 자연스럽게 녹여져 거부감 없이 마지막 단편까지 꽤 재미있게 읽었다. 개인적으로 마지막에 모모미와 히다가 잘 이어졌으면 좋겠다는 생각까지 들었다.

연애소설의 단골인 감정과 사람의 엇갈림, 헤매며 마지막에 만남으로 끝나는 단편들. 매번 드는 생각이지만 남자 작가가 여자의 생각이나 섬세하고 미묘한 행동을 잘 묘사하는 점이 매번 신기하다.",4,,41

Cuốn này ngắn, đọc nửa ngày là xong. Phần “cáp treo cabin” đầu tiên là phần hay nhất truyện khi các tình tiết được sắp xếp rất kịch tính. Nhưng cũng chỉ có phần đấy là hay thôi. Những phần còn lại khá nhàm chán và nhạt đối với mình, plottwist không ấn tượng và chắc do phong cách dịch nên mình thấy khá là trẻ con. Kết truyện cũng không quá khó đoán nhưng cũng không ấn tượng.
P/s mình đồng cảm với đoạn Miyuki nói về việc Kota ngoại tình: “Tớ sẽ nói rõ cho anh ấy biết trước rằng tớ chịu đựng việc ngoại tình nhưng không có nghĩa sẽ tha thứ cho hành động đó”.

Có màu đỏ đậm như cánh hoa hồng nhung, cũng có màu đỏ nhạt gần như màu hồng nhưng vẫn không được gọi là màu hồng. Nó gần giống màu đỏ son, song nếu được hỏi thì quả nhiên nó vẫn nghiêng sang sắc đỏ, thứ màu rất khó phân biệt. Nó thiên về màu nào thì còn tùy thuộc vào cá tính của người đó.

#Cáp_treo_tình_yêu #KeigoHigashino #Jan0103 #y2020 #Mintbooks
Khai bút đầu năm (dương) bằng một cuốn cũng mơi mới của Keigo. Với tốc độ sáng tác và mua bản quyền cũng như vô số nhà xuất bản nắm bắt được thị hiếu thì truyện của Keigo ở Việt Nam xuất bản nhiều như gà đẻ trứng. Thay vì chọn những cuốn nặng đề tài xã hội hay trinh thám, Mintbooks lựa chọn Cáp treo tình yêu, theo mình là một option khá nhẹ nhàng.
Cáp treo tình yêu, đúng như tựa đề, hiểu đơn giản là những câu truyện tình yêu được diễn ra tại khu trượt tuyết tại khu nước nóng Satozawa. Những người trẻ tuổi (theo như truyện thì họ cũng không trẻ lắm, nhưng mình nghĩ với 1 nước dân số già thì 30-40 vẫn là trẻ chán), họ gặp nhau, yêu nhau, đôi khi họ lầm tưởng đấy là tình yêu, đôi khi họ lầm tưởng tình yêu là trọn đời, rồi những cái lầm tưởng lại trở thành tội lỗi. Trọn vẹn như một vòng cáp treo, có đi lên thì phải đi xuống, bắt đầu và kết thúc đều từ một cuộc gặp gỡ trong cáp treo, nơi thế giới dù rộng lớn thế mà ta vẫn tình cờ gặp những việc vô cùng oái ăm.
Ở lời tựa trên bìa 4, cuốn truyện được giới thiệu “Đứng trước tình yêu, con người sẽ trở nên thảm hại, ích kỷ, hoặc nhiều dũng khí đến thế nào?”. Có lẽ cũng đúng một phần, nhưng mình muốn nhìn theo hướng rộng hơn, rằng cách xử lý tình huống trong tình yêu, cũng là cách chúng ta hành xử với xã hội và những mối quan hệ xung quanh. Một Kota luôn tìm điều có lợi cho bản thân, sẵn sàng đổ lỗi cho người khác, một Miyuki những tưởng nắm bắt được mọi người nhưng hóa ra vẫn không hiểu được hết dù là người sống cạnh cô hàng ngày, một Momomi những tưởng cam chịu dễ tính nhưng lại luôn suy nghĩ kỹ trước khi lựa chọn bước vào một mối quan hệ, hay một Mizuki sống với tôn chỉ: “lời nói chẳng mất tiền mua, lựa lời mà nói cho vừa lòng nhau” nhưng chỉ khát khao thỏa mãn mong muốn của bản thân,…
Những con người xuất hiện trong truyện không quá xa lạ, mình sẽ gặp đầy xung quanh luôn. Keigo vẫn rất tài tình trong việc biến những đề tài quen thuộc thành một câu chuyện hay ho. Cái hay nhất trong Cáp treo tình yêu với mình là việc tạo nên dòng thời gian. Dù mạch truyện nhanh, nhưng rõ ràng những tình huống xảy ra trên khu trượt tuyết của Satozawa không phải trong ngày một ngày hai. Có những cú nhảy thời gian: 1 năm, 4 tháng. 6 tháng…Việc này khiến mình thấy truyện hợp lý, khá là “đời”, chứ không phải việc không thể xảy ra, hay những cái mà mình phải chặc miệng “truyện mà”. Dòng thời gian dài cũng giúp các mối quan hệ được xây dựng trong truyện không khiên cưỡng chút nào.
Cách Keigo sử dụng kết mở cho mọi tình huống xảy ra tại khu trượt tuyết cũng đặt người đọc vào tình trạng phải tự vẽ nên cái kết mình mong muốn. Nghĩa là chẳng có chính – tà, đúng – sai , chỉ đơn giản là mỗi người đọc tự đoán định cái kết cục mà mình muốn – hoặc kết cục mà mình thỏa mãn nhất: có thể là họ vẫn bên nhau, có thể là Hida sẽ vẫn lựa chọn làm tiếp những gì dang dở, cũng có thể Miyuki sẽ lại lần nữa nhắm mắt cho qua và nghĩ rằng đang nắm điểm yếu của người khác,…
Dĩ nhiên, khen thì khen thế, nhưng mình không thích truyện này. Mình cũng không bất ngờ với bất kỳ phần nào của truyện. Hoặc có lẽ cuộc đời mình may mắn cũng gặp kha khá tình huống như thế nên đọc đến đâu đã hình dung ra bước tiếp theo như nào. Chính vì thế với cái tựa giới thiệu “đứng trước tình yêu…” mình chả thích, bởi tình yêu hay tình bạn hay dăm ba cái quan hệ, quan trọng chỉ là lựa chọn của mỗi người, và chẳng ai có quyền ngồi phán xét rằng lựa chọn cách sống như thế là đúng hay sai (dĩ nhiên trừ mấy cái phạm pháp hẳn ra nhé), như câu trích ở đầu bài viết: “Cũng có lúc bản thân mình nghĩ hợp với màu đó thì người ngoài lại nghĩ là không”
Và thực ra,tất cả tình huống xảy ra trong truyện, với mình vẫn là những lời nhắc nhở đã cũ mèm nhưng chẳng bao giờ sai (để năm mới bớt sân si khẩu nghiệp):
- Không muốn người khác biết chỉ có không làm
- Chỉ có cá mới biết sống trong nước thích thế nào
- Tình yêu thì chẳng bao giờ có lỗi, nhưng làm người thì nên có đạo đức",3,2 likes,41

Mình đọc cuốn này khá từ tốn để phân biệt được rõ các nhân vật, nên không thấy bị rối hay khó hiểu như 1 số bạn nhận xét. Các nhân vật tuy không được miêu tả quá chi tiết về gia cảnh nhưng vẫn có những nét tính cách đặc trưng riêng, và mỗi câu chuyện xoay quanh họ lại có những điểm thú vị độc đáo, đúng thực sự là phải bật cười ấy, nhưng không hoàn toàn vì vui thú mà vì mấy tình huống ấy éo le, oái oăm biết bao :))

Dù có ác ý hay vô tình đi nữa, mỗi người đều muốn điều tốt nhất cho bản thân mình, hoặc tìm cách lấp liếm đi những cái sai đã làm với người khác. Trách Kota mười thì cũng phải trách Mizuki ba bốn phần, thương Miyuki một thì phải thương Hida với Momomi mười.

Ban đầu mình cũng không kỳ vọng lắm về cuốn này vì nó không thuộc dòng trinh thám, nhưng thực sự đọc xong mình phải thán phục sự đa dạng trong sáng tác và khéo léo trong cài cắm những tình huống tưởng như không liên quan mà lại có hệ luỵ mật thiết với nhau của bác Keigo.",4,1 like,41

Trong câu chuyện này có rất nhiều nhân vật khác nhau, và tác giả đã kết nối họ lại với nhau bằng những tình huống cả éo le cả lãng mạn. Tới cuối hầu hết mọi người đều được hạnh phúc cả, chỉ còn duyên nợ giữa Momomi và vợ chồng Miyuki thì không biết sẽ thế nào :')

Tuyệt chiêu khai thác diễn biến tâm lý nhân vật của tác giả vẫn phát huy tác dụng hiệu quả như ngày nào. Nhân vật ngoại tình mà mình cũng thấy hồi hộp theo :)) Nói tới chuyện ngoại tình thì có vẻ điều ấy khá phổ biến ở Nhật. Nam nữ có người yêu nhưng chưa kết hôn vẫn có thể ""tìm hiểu"" búa xua thoải mái. Đọc hơi lăn tăn tí vì theo quan điểm của mình thì như vậy là vi phạm đạo đức á 🥴

Chương cuối là bất ngờ và cũng để lại nhiều suy nghĩ cho mình nhất. Đó là những băn khoăn của 1 cô gái khi tự hỏi mình có thật sự yêu thích người kia hay không? hay chỉ là những rung động nhất thời, do người khác vun vào, do tuổi tác đến lúc cần phải xây dựng gia đình? Tình huống khi đối mặt với vấn đề của cô gái và chàng trai cũng rất thú vị :)) Thấy rõ sự khác biệt trong suy nghĩ của nam và nữ. Có lẽ ta nên thẳng thắn thành thật với nhau hơn là cứ suy đoán lung tung rồi thất vọng về nhau. Mấy trang sau chót, tác giả lại dẫn dắt đến cảm xúc hoàn toàn mới. Kết luận lại thì trong mọi câu chuyện phiếm, người có lỗi luôn là người vắng mặt. Khi muốn biện minh cho bản thân thì ai cũng xấu xa vậy đó '..'",3,1 like,41

review_4578371259,Hoang Pham,"Feb 27, 2022","CÁP TREO TÌNH YÊU là một trong những cuốn tiểu thuyết của Keigo mà tôi tâm đắc nhất trong mảng tâm lý xã hội. Một cuốn sách viết về tình yêu giản dị nhưng không giản đơn, nhẹ nhàng, sâu lắng và ám ảnh bởi những tiếng cười chua cay.

Vì là chuyện tình cảm, chú trọng đến bối cảnh nên Keigo viết với tiết tấu chậm, các tuyến nhân vật tương đối nhiều, các câu chuyện tình của họ lúc đầu khá rời rạc, riêng biệt, chẳng liên quan gì đến nhau. Điển hình như ngay chương đầu tiên, kết chương một cách bất ngờ, thú vị, có thể coi như đã xong một câu chuyện ngắn hài hước. Chương hai tiếp nối với một câu chuyện khác, càng củng cố niềm tin đây chắc là một tuyển tập truyện ngắn. Không, không phải vậy. Khi chương ba nhẹ nhàng trườn vô, mạch truyện phát triển rộng hơn thì những mảnh đời tưởng chừng như không có điểm giao thoa ấy lại được gắn kết với nhau một cách kỳ lạ tại một khu du lịch trượt tuyết nổi tiếng, nơi sự thật thầm kín được phơi bày cùng những tình huống dở khóc dở cười khiến bạn phải bật cười sảng khoái.

Những câu chuyện tình của Keigo đưa ra trong cuốn tiểu thuyết này đâu chỉ có những rung cảm long lanh sắc hồng, ở đó lòng chung thủy đang bị lung lay bởi khao khát kiếm tìm những cảm xúc mới lạ, ước mơ về hạnh phúc gia đình bị thử thách khi buông thả bản thân đắm chìm vào những cuộc hẹn hò đầy cám dỗ nhục dục, lòng bao dung liệu có đủ lớn để tha thứ cho những gian dối trong trò chơi tình ái? Rất khó để trả lời. Thế nhưng, tất cả những tình huống đó chỉ là bối cảnh để Keigo đưa ra một thông điệp rất đáng báo động, đó là vấn nạn của văn hoá nói xấu sau lưng ai đó luôn tồn tại mọi nơi, mọi xã hội. Đó là một thực trạng mà ai cũng thấy. Keigo cũng thế, ông thấy hết, và… Cáp Treo Tình Yêu đã được ông lồng ghép rất nhiều trăn trở về căn bệnh nói dối, cũng như văn hoá nói xấu sau lưng.

Trong đời, nếu ai dám vỗ ngực tuyên bố ""Tôi chưa từng nói dối"" thì cứ inbox tôi, tôi sẽ đến, quỳ gối & cung kính lậy 3 lậy, sau đó ăn gì tôi cúng. Tôi thề có Chúa tôi sẽ làm thế.

Thực ra, nói dối cũng không hẳn xấu. Có muôn vạn đường để lời nói dối được thoát ra cũng như muôn vạn nẻo để sinh tồn trong cuộc đời này. Nói dối mà chẳng ảnh hưởng đến ai mà nó còn tốt cho cả tình huống hiện tại, tốt cho cả mục đích của người nói, thì nói thôi. Kiểu như nói dối nhiều khi là để đối phương đỡ đau hơn, đỡ phải đối diện với nỗi đau. Hoặc giả nói dối vì nói thật có khi còn khiến người khác tổn thương nhiều hơn thế. Vậy nên khi cần người ta vẫn nên nói dối. Dù cho hành vi ấy không được khuyến khích và về cơ bản thì nó vẫn là hành động không tốt. Văn hóa nhân loại nó quy định thế, chứ tôi chẳng biết gì đâu nhá.

Nói dối mà làm tổn thương người ta thì nên tránh. Tuyệt đối tránh. Tất nhiên, trong đời, mấy ai tránh được mãi. Nhưng tránh được lúc nào tốt lúc đó. Vì nó xấu. Thế thôi.

Cuốn sách rất hay, đáng đọc. Cái kết thì siêu siêu đỉnh, shock, đầy hụt hẫng cùng tiếng gào thét của nhân vật trong truyện, và được cộng hưởng bởi tiếng gào đầy cay cú của tôi nữa. Trời ơi! Vậy mà là tình yêu hả, tiêu đề gắn hình ảnh cáp treo với tình yêu mà, nó phải kết thúc đẹp để toát lên biểu tượng cáp treo tình yêu chứ, tình yêu gì mà như thế, vậy là 285 trang sách trước đó bị vứt vô sọt rác hả? Ô hô…a ha…bla bla. Hãy tỉnh táo, nên nhớ Keigo là bậc thầy khắc họa tâm lý nhân vật, tình huống, rồi dắt chúng ta ngoan ngoãn theo sau. Thật đau đớn, hệt như những lần trước, tôi lại bị lừa.

Cái kết chơi vơi này, chẳng biết tác giả lừa hay do NXB dịch để lừa nhưng đã gieo vô người đọc cái dòng chữ SAYONARA với cách hiểu tiêu cực là vĩnh biệt. Gấp cuốn sách lại, tôi gần như suy sụp, hụt hững, shock nặng vì cái kết. Sau đó, vì không cam lòng, nên đã đọc đi đọc lại đoạn kết, phân tích hết cả những lần đã trải nghiệm đi cáp treo ở Vinpearl, Bà Nà HILL, Đà Lạt… rồi cười một mình sung sướng. Xưa, tôi cười rất tự nhiên, từ ngày lọt hố Keigo, tôi hay TỰ NHIÊN cười.

review_3678139310,Diệc Điểu,"Dec 05, 2020","Keigo ko cần khai thác quá sâu vào nhân vật, người đọc vẫn biết rõ người nào thế nào, cách sống và tính cách của họ.
Câu chuyện nhẹ nhàng nhưng vẫn lồng ghép được rất nhiều thông điệp: về suy nghĩ của những ng đứng trước ngưỡng cửa hôn nhân, về chuyện tìm bạn đời, về việc ngoại tình trong hành động và trong tâm tưởng, về sự lựa chọn của mỗi người.. Có lẽ ko ai trên đời có thể hiểu hết về ng đang sống bên mình, nhg việc có chấp nhận để họ ở bên ta hay ko là do sự lựa chọn của chính mình.
Cách kể chuyện của Keigo vẫn vậy, cuốn hút qua từng trang sách. Những cú rẽ ngoặt đều thú vị. Bố cục hợp lý. Thủ pháp truyện lồng truyện. Ý nghĩa ẩn dụ trong những vòng cáp treo.
Điểm trừ là cái kết và bìa sách.
Cái kết mở để ng đọc tự suy đoán, nhg trong tr hợp câu chuyện này mình muốn nó dk rõ ràng.
Bìa sách ko xấu nhưng cá nhân mình thấy ko phù hợp, nó sẽ có hiệu quả hơn nếu dùng cho một cuốn ngôn tình trẻ nào đó, bởi ""Cáp treo tình yêu"" theo mình nó là tâm lý xã hội, chứ ko phải ngôn tình cẩu huyết. Chính bìa sách khiến mình ko muốn mua cuốn này vì nghĩ nó ""nông"" và ko hợp với những cuốn anh em cùng ""cha"" của nó mà mình có trên kệ. Tuy vậy cơ duyên khi thấy em nó đk giảm quá nhiều trong hội sách az nên mới hốt về, và trải nghiệm đọc tốt hơn mong đợi.",3,0 likes,41

Vẫn lối viết quen thuộc với các câu chuyện riêng lẻ nhưng đều có một mối liên kết chặt chẽ với nhau, “Cáp treo tình yêu” xoay quanh những éo le về tình yêu mà các cặp đôi thường gặp phải, trong đó các nhân vật chính có đều có chung một mắt xích – cùng đến một khu nghỉ dưỡng trượt tuyết.

Điểm sáng của cuốn này là ở lối tác giả miêu tả tâm lý nhân vật. Tâm lý của ông chồng ngoại tình mà bị bắt quả tang, tâm lý lo lắng khi cầu hôn, tâm lý sau khi đổ vỡ, … tất cả đều rất chân thực và tự nhiên. Mình tin những ai từng đọc cuốn này đều sẽ bật cười ở cách ông xây dựng tình huống một cách rất là tréo ngoe :)) để rồi tò mò bị cuốn vào đó và đọc một lèo hết sạch cả truyện. Truyện của Keigo-sensei thường là kết mở, tuy có chút hụt hẫng nhưng nếu nghĩ theo cách khác thì đó là một cơ hội cho bạn tự tưởng tượng ra cái kết theo ý mình. Lúc đọc xong mình đã cùng một người bạn ngồi tự chế ra cái kết khá là ưng ý, khá là vui :))

Điểm trừ của “Cáp treo tình yêu” là hệ thống nhân vật khó nhớ. Tên người Nhật cứ na ná nhau, lúc gọi tên, lúc gọi họ. Mình bị choáng ở hồi đầu, không phân biệt được giới tính, ai với ai, cứ phải lật qua lật lại xem nhân vật đó đã xuất hiện hay chưa, điều này làm gián đoạn quá trình đọc khiến mình không thoải mái. Sách của Keigo thì đọc lại lần hai sẽ thấy hay hơn, vì lúc đó trong đầu đã hình dung ra nhân vật, và sẽ thật sự chìm đắm vào câu chuyện hơn.

Đây không phải trinh thám mà thiên về tâm lý nên không phù hợp với những bạn thích hành động, bí ẩn, giải đố. Còn nếu bạn thích tâm lý, thì “Cáp treo tình yêu” là dành cho bạn!",4,0 likes,41

review_4425410395,Ges,"Dec 30, 2021","Truyện này đúng ra phải đc xếp vào thể loại ngôn tình mới đúng, nhưng vì là truyện của bác Keigo nên vẫn xin up lên vài dòng....xin nói trc là chỉ có chê và chê thôi, hehe!
Chê thứ nhất: bối cảnh của truyện
Câu chuyện xoay quanh một khu phức hợp nghỉ dưỡng, suối nước nóng và trượt tuyết tên là Satozawa - nơi diễn ra những tình huống bi hài của tất cả những nhân vật trong truyện....cách sắp xếp những mẩu chuyện nhỏ vốn tưởng chừng rời rạc, lại ghép thành 1 bức tranh lớn vốn là 1 trong những sở trường của Keigo sensei, tuy nhiên thì cá nhân mình thấy lần này bác làm hơi khiên cưỡng, khiến cho mình đọc mà cứ thấy gợn gợn, ko thuyết phục!.... có lẽ bởi bối cảnh của truyện hơi hẹp và đơn điệu, và cũng có thể phần nào do mình ko quen đọc thể loại tiểu thuyết diễm tình này lắm, nên mình thấy hơi ảo và phi thực tế....
Chê thứ hai: tuyến nhân vật!
Số lượng nhân vật vốn cũng ko nhiều nhưng ko được khai thác kĩ càng nên ai cũng có cá tính nhàn nhạt, chẳng để lại ấn tượng (với độc giả nữ chắc sẽ có ấn tượng hơn với Kota, Mizuki, Hida )....chưa kể còn đưa ra những nhân vật râu ria xung quanh mà vai trò ko rõ ràng, cũng chẳng có cái kết nào cho họ cả ☹....có vẻ với Cáp treo tình yêu, tác giả định làm mới bản thân hoàn toàn, muốn thử sức ở phong cách khác chăng? Nếu có thế thật thì có lẽ đây là 1 thử nghiệm thất bại!....việc tạo dựng nhân vật kiểu này khiến mình ko nhận ra đây là truyện của Keigo luôn, lỏng lẻo và hời hợt vô cùng!
Chê thứ 3: nội dung, chủ đề và cái kết
Có lẽ khi chắp bút viết, Keigo muốn truyền tải thông điệp: thế giới này trông có vẻ mênh mông, nhưng lại chỉ là khối cầu bé tí....và trong cái khối cầu đó, mỗi con người là 1 mảnh ghép tạo nên thế giới, đều có mối liên kết vô hình với nhau, và ai cũng có 1 nửa nữa cho riêng mình, như những miếng ghép có thể lắp vừa khít với nhau....vấn đề là như khi chơi ghép tranh, ko phải lúc nào ta cũng tìm ngay ra cho mình miếng ghép thích hợp còn thiếu, và chỉ cần nhầm lẫn chút thôi, bức tranh đc tạo thành sẽ rất khác (kiểu kiểu vậy, mình ko giỏi ví von lắm)....thế nhưng cách thể hiện triết lý của tác giả qua câu chuyện ko thực sự rõ ràng và có phần bế tắc, nó tù túng, nó ko thoát đc ý và khiến mình thấy khá nhạt nhẽo khi đọc về cái cách xử lý tình huống tréo ngoe trong truyện....đọc xong chỉ thấy 1 điều: các bạn FA lâu năm chả có lý do gì mà than thở chuyện tình yêu khi ngoài kia vẫn đang còn 1 Hida đang quằn quại với nỗi đau thất tình hết lần này đến lần khác....hay chính ra đểu 1 chút, sở khanh 1 chút có khi lại hay ....
và cuối cùng là cái kết: cái kết ửng lơ và vô duyên vô cùng!.... bạn nào fan Keigo lâu năm, chuyên gia phân tích truyện của Keigo giải thích cho mình dụng ý của đoạn kết với? Mình chịu đấy!

Tóm lại, cá nhân mình đánh giá đây là 1 tiểu thuyết dở của Keigo, là 1 bước thụt lùi trong phong cách của nhà văn người Nhật!

review_4429714167,hờ mia,"Jan 14, 2022","Lúc mới đọc quyển này mình chỉ cho 2⭐️ là cùng (cái bìa và cốt truyện cũng ổn), giọng văn của cuốn này, không biết do dịch giả hay do là tác phẩm đời đầu của bác, rất chán, đọc như mấy bài status hay ngôn tình trên mạng ấy. Các tình tiết thì khá rời rạc, tuy là truyện tình cảm nhưng lại không cho thấy sự lãng mạn nhiều. Tuy nhiên đọc đến giữa sách thì mình vô cùng bất ngờ, vì giữa những câu truyện tưởng như rời rạc ấy lại có một sự liên kết đáng nhạc nhiên. Tất cả các nhân vật đều dính líu đến nhau, và các câu chuyện của họ cũng vậy. Thành thử ra, đọc xong rồi mình vẫn phải tẩn ngẩn ngồi sắp xếp lại các sự việc và nhân vật để xem mối quan hệ giữa họ. Cách kể truyện rất logic, rất liên quan và rất Higashino Keigo.

🚠 Tuy nhiên, mình vẫn chưa ưng cuốn này lắm, vì dù có sự liên kết thật đấy, nhưng cái duyên, cái tình cờ rất không ngờ ấy lại khiến mình thấy hơi sượng trân. Nữa là cái kiểu cứ giới thiệu đi giới thiệu lại nhân vật làm mình khó chịu. Và dù cái cách xử lý tình huống của tác giả làm mình gật gù đồng tình, nhưng nó vẫn chưa tới khi so với những tác phẩm sau này. Nên mình không recommend nó cho những bạn nào là fan của bác Keigo.",0,0 likes,41
review_4301424649,Le Huong,"Oct 22, 2021","** spoiler alert ** Thực sự đọc xong cuốn này mình thấy cũng không đọng lại được nhiều thứ. Vè nội dung thì cơ bản đây là những câu chuyện về tình yêu của những con người tưởng chừng xa lạ nhưng lại được liên kết chặt chẽ bởi một khu trượt tuyết . Nhưng tình yêu ở truyện không màu hồng mà có phần tăm tối, trần trụi hơn, trong đó có cả chuyện ngoại tình. Có vẻ ngoại tình ở đây khá bình thường và có thể chấp nhận được, nhưng thực sự với bản thân mình thì KHÔNG nên đến những đoạn đó thì mình lại thấyhơi khó chịu và có phần thắc mắc lối cư xử của các nhân vật (Tại sao thấy tội lỗi nhưng vẫn muốn lên giường với cô bạn gái mới trước khi kết hôn để rồi làm khổ cả 2 người con gái?; Tại sao bị phản bội mà vẫn dễ dàng tha thứ trong khi đáng lẽ có thể tìm được hạnh phúc mới?; Tại sao nhóm bạn biết anh này đào hoa, thích cặp bồ,..mà vẫn gán ghép 2 anh chị một lễ cầu hôn trong chính ngày anh ta lập kế hoạch định đưa cô gái khác lên giường? Và đặc biệt là hành động túng quẫn của nhân vật cuối truyện, KHÔNG THỂ HIỂU NỔI! sao phải từ bỏ cuộc đời vì một tên bẩn thỉu, đáng khinh,...trong khi chị hoàn toàn có thể tìm cách giải quyết khác và cuối cùng vẫn bên cạnh hạnh phúc với người yêu mới??)
Về hình thức ,thì nói chung dù cốt truyện không gay cấn đặc biệt , nhưng lối dẫn dắt và văn phong của Keigo chưa bao giờ làm mình thấy chán. Nó nhẹ nhàng, chậm rãi nhưng vừa đủ để giữ mình đến cuối truyện.

Chốt lại đây là một cuốn không đến nỗi dở tệ nhưng cũng không để lại cho mình nhiều ấn tượng, suy nghĩ, hay bài học. Mình sẽ không đọc lại và có lẽ cũng sẽ không nhớ nhiều về nó trong tương lại.",3,0 likes,41
review_4289133873,Trần Tuệ Minh,"Oct 18, 2021","Nếu đây không phải là Keigo sensei thì mình thấy cũng khá ổn.
Câu chuyện làm mình liên tưởng đến C-drama dài tập: Một nhóm nhân vật và những chuyện tình cảm rối rắm đan xen.
Cái hay là tác giả đưa cái kết trở về điểm xuất phát, bởi vậy tác giả đã đặt tên chương cuối là Replay. Mình thích điều này khi câu chuyện được bo tròn một cách khéo léo.
Ngoài ra thì cuốn sách còn truyền tải 1 thông điệp xã hội nữa là việc kết hôn trước 30 tuổi. Xem ra không chỉ có người trẻ VN mà Nhật Bản cũng khá đau đầu về vấn đề này. Nhưng mình xin phép trích dẫn 1 câu mình mới đọc đc trong 1 cuốn sách gần đây: đừng kết hôn khi mọi tế bào trong cơ thể bạn không sẵn sàng cho điều đó.
Sai lầm thường hay bắt nguồn từ sự vội vàng. Nước đến chân mới nhảy thì hay nhảy nhầm vũng bùn lắm. Vẫn là nên học bơi phải khum mọi người 😅
Cuốn thứ 2 đọc của bác về đề tài trượt tuyết . Có vẻ sensei rất thích môn thể thao này.
⚠️ SPOILER
Mình đã suy nghĩ rất nhiều về cái kết. Đó là một cái kết mở để người đọc tùy ý lựa chọn số phận của nhận vật. Thế nhưng dù kết thế nào thì mũi dao vẫn chĩa về phía nạn nhân. Và mình thực sự không thích điều đó. Đây là một cái kết khiên cưỡng, có phần bức tử nhân vật. Những con người được xây dựng trong tác phẩm đều ngấp nghé 30 tuổi, đủ trí tuệ và bản lĩnh để đối mặt với những tai ương của cuộc sống mà không cần đánh mất phẩm giá. Tuổi 30 đâu phải là án tử phải không nào?
Thế nên mình hy vọng một cái kết khác nhân văn hơn, kẻ không xứng đang sẽ phải bẽ mặt còn người vô tình bị cuốn vào rối rắm sẽ gỡ được mình ra khỏi mớ bòng bong. Đâu phải cứ tác giả truyện trinh thám thì không thể viết được kịch bản phim truyền hình phải không? 😅",2,0 likes,41
review_4381974818,Thanh Hang NGUYEN,"Dec 10, 2021","Mình chọn đọc quyển này vì sách có vẻ hợp để đọc vào mùa đông. Bảy câu chuyện nhỏ với bối cảnh chung là khu trượt tuyết, những lần đi cáp lên xuống cùng nhau của các nhân vật, và bao nhiêu hẹn hò, hẹn thề, phản bội, cầu hôn,…

Mình nghĩ đây lại là 1 tác phẩm ghi dấu sự thử nghiệm mới của Keigo Higasgino về phong cách và cốt truyện, khi mà nội dung không phải thể loại trinh thám như thường lệ. Nếu như quyển “Điều kỳ diệu ở tiệm tạp hoá Namiya” rất dễ thương với những điều kỳ diệu và cảm động giữa 1 nhóm bạn trẻ và người chủ tiệm ngày xưa, thì truyện này lại theo thể loại tình cảm hẳn với sự nhẹ nhàng nhưng không kém phần kịch tính với nhiều diễn biến bất ngờ. Tuy vậy, mình không nghĩ quyển này là 1 truyện hay của Keigo Higashino vì văn phong đôi khi lê thê và dài dòng, tâm lý nhân vật khá mờ nhạt. Mình không kết luận thể loại tình cảm không phải sở trường của tác giả, mà hy vọng những quyển sau, nếu vẫn thuộc thể loại này, sẽ thành công hơn.",3,0 likes,41

Khoảng cách giữa quen nhau và hôn nhau rất xa nhau, và tiến tới hôn nhân là một quyết định vô cùng trọng đại. Kota là hình mẫu điển hình của bất cứ người đàn ông nào, đặc biệt là ở Nhật Bản, có một thái độ e dè với chuyện kết hôn. Và nghiêm trọng hơn, là lại có tư tưởng ngoại tình!
- Thành công sẽ đến khi mọi thứ đến điểm chín muồi! Mọi thứ sẽ phải kiên nhẫn chờ đợi mới có thể đạt được thành công. Hida vì quá nóng vội mà mọi kế hoạch cầu kì của anh bị thất bại, ngay trước mặt.
- Cáp treo tình yêu là một bức thông điệp, là một bức tranh về tình yêu. Tình yêu làm con người ta say đắm trong nó, để rồi chính những người trong cuộc đem lại nỗi khổ cho nhau. Nếu muốn một câu chuyện tình bền vững, phải xuất phát từ cả hai phía!",3,0 likes,41

Ôi cái kết… 🤪
Dù biết trước đây không phải trinh thám, nhưng vẫn có chút mong chờ vì từng ấn tượng tài năng của tác giả từ hồi Namiya. Với mình quyển này không đặc sắc, lúc đọc còn có cảm giác như khu trượt tuyết ở Satozawa đặt hàng tác giả viết cuốn này vậy, tả cảnh với khen dịch vụ hơi nhiều. Cốt truyện mình thấy hơi thường so với mặt bằng fiction chung, chứ nếu so với các cốt truyện khác mà bác Keigo từng viết thì quyển này còn kém rấttttt xa. Mấy nhân vật nam chủ chốt của câu chuyện kiểu cách cứ hạ tiện thế nào, bắt cá hai tay đến lúc vỡ lở thì đặt điều khổ thân tôi bị hại, rồi lại nói xấu đồng nghiệp nữ, nịnh nọt, có ông thì lại khù khờ một cách vô lý (lúc gặp khách hàng thì EQ siêu cao @@)... mình chỉ ấn tượng mỗi Nezu nhân viên của khu trượt tuyết (lại nghĩ khu trượt tuyết này có book bác già quảng cáo không mà từ cảnh quang đến phục vụ đều tốt hết sức LOL). Lúc đọc tình tiết thì ngang phè mà chốt hạ quả kết hết hồn, thấy hành xử cái kết không hợp lý lắm vì nhân vật cũng từng trải nhiều chứ đâu phải non nớt gì. Overrated.",3,0 likes,41
review_4303956262,Hoàng Vũ Dương,"Nov 10, 2021","Không có một câu chuyện điều tra gay cấn, gây tò mò, hay những cú twist không thể tin được, lần này tác giả Keigo Higashino đưa đến cho các bạn đọc cuốn sách về những câu chuyện tình cảm, tâm lý nhẹ nhàng, ẩn chứa những bài học về tình yêu, sự kết nối trong các mối quan hệ trong cuộc sống.
So với các tác phẩm khác của tiên sinh thì cuốn sách này thật sự không hấp dẫn bằng nhưng không vì thế mà nó không thú vị và đặc sắc. Mình thấy đọc tác phẩm khá dễ đọc, cách dẫn dắt truyện và kết nối các câu chuyện với nhau khá là độc đáo. Nội dung từng câu chuyện đều có những đặc trưng và tầng nghĩa riêng.
Mình thấy tác phẩm có vẻ không có chất lượng cao, kinh khủng như những tác phẩm khác của bác Keigo như Đơn phương, Thánh giá rỗng,... nhưng nó vẫn có chất lượng, các câu chuyện diễn ra khá tự nhiên và cũng có phần lôi cuốn trong đó đối với mình.
Mình thấy tác phẩm phù hợp đối với những độc giả muốn câu chuyện nhẹ nhàng, đời thường trong cuộc sống.",4,0 likes,41
review_4667832934,Daria Duong,"Apr 16, 2022","Mỗi khi bị reading slump mình đều tìm đến sách của Keigo-sensei, vì hễ đọc vào là lại cuốn không dứt được. Cáp treo tình yêu không phải là truyện trinh thám, không có yếu tố giật gân hay bí ẩn nào cần giải đáp mà chỉ đơn thuần là câu chuyện về tình yêu, tình bạn của những người trẻ sắp chạm đầu ba ở Nhật Bản. Cốt truyện đều đều, có phần hơi nhạt nhưng chẳng hiểu sao vẫn cứ lôi cuốn mình háo hức lật liên tục để biết chuyện gì sẽ xảy đến tiếp theo, dù quá nhiều sự trùng hợp cùng xảy đến một lúc như vậy thì đúng là chỉ có trong tiểu thuyết. Sách đọc giải trí nhẹ nhàng rất ổn, nhưng cái kết quá vội vàng đã khiến mình hoang mang tột độ đến nỗi phải đánh 2 sao vì mãi vẫn chưa hiểu cuối cùng chuyện gì đã xảy ra với cô gái ấy. :(((",2,0 likes,41

review_4062886001,Fene,"Jun 21, 2021","《祈禱落幕時》是加賀系列裡的第十本書，也是最後一本書，我總算把加賀系列全讀完，得向恭一郎告別啦。特別喜歡加賀系列是因為他辦的案件都不是一貫窮兇極惡的犯罪團伙，故事核心不強調揪出兇手，而是挑戰道德倫理底線，經由加賀的探案過程帶出小市民之間的各種感情羈絆。

自私自利的母親偷走家裡的財務，還以丈夫的名義借下高利貸後一走了之，父親被迫帶著幼女連夜潛逃。走投無路之下，父親打算瞞著女兒跳崖自盡，以死抵債，不料一場小事故卻誤打誤撞地讓另一個人代替了父親去死，而父親則得以用另一個陌生身份繼續活下去。但是，選擇這樣苟且的活著，代價就是得和女兒分開兩地，從此各自生活，大概終身都不得再相認。

女兒覺得自己犧牲了父親的人生才能活下去，背負著原生家庭帶給她的親情瘡疤，她從不敢奢望尋常人的家庭溫暖，任何奢求只會讓她的罪孽更加深重。她知道，真正的天譴總有一天會降臨她的頭上，警察的到來只是時間問題。在得知父親與加賀母親的感情以後，即使加賀母親已經去世，她還是希望見見這個女人的兒子，她希望通過和加賀交談來認識那個對父親十分重要的女人。然而，正是因為加賀，自己和父親手沾鮮血的秘密即將被公之於眾，父女倆猙獰的親情馬上就要落幕。

從另一方面來說，這個故事裡的兇手都不是罪大惡極的壞人: 前期是誤殺，後面是父親為了維護女兒的仕途而殺人滅口。當真兇浮出水面時，真相並沒有讓人覺得特別痛快。讓人真正感慨的反而是那搭著數條人命的父女情，父親給的愛越來越沉重、越來越極端，最終衍生出既扭曲又殘酷的犯罪動機。

加賀一直以為母親是因為父親對職業過於熱愛而離家出走，我記得在《紅手指》裡有提到過，父親得知母親離世時孤身一人，所以父親病危時毅然下定決心要獨自面對死亡。父親臨終時，加賀為了配合父親的遺願，只能默默地守在了醫院外面。《祈禱落幕時》以加賀母親當初拋家棄子的原因做為結尾，解開了積壓在加賀心裡多年的鬱結，也給這個系列落下了完美的帷幕。",4,0 likes,43

Thi thể đã phân hủy của một người phụ nữ 40 tuổi được tìm thấy trong căn hộ ở Kosuge. Tuy nhiên, người đứng tên thuê căn hộ là Matsuo Koshikawa - người không có bất kỳ liên hệ nào với nạn nhân, và Matsuo đã mất tích. Matsumiya Shuhei, người thuộc Phòng điều tra số 1, cho rằng vụ án này có liên hệ đến một vụ án thiêu chết một người đàn ông vô gia cư tại Shin-Koiwa.

Cuốn sách xen kẽ nhiều góc nhìn, những phần đầu có liên tiếp các sự kiện đặt ra nhiều câu hỏi. Nạn nhân trước khi chết đã đến tìm người bạn lâu năm chưa gặp, Hiromi Asai - người làm đạo diễn, biên kịch. Kaga Koichiro - thám tử thuộc Nihonbashi, đã dựa trên những manh mối tại căn hộ ở Kosuge và phát hiện ra, vụ án có liên hệ với mẹ của anh ấy - người đã bỏ đi hơn 10 năm.

Nhiều điều bí ẩn là thế, nhưng mình tiếc là phần điều tra quá nhàm chán. So với hai quyển trong series Ngón tay đỏ và Newcomer thì rõ ràng quyển này không khiến mình hứng thú, mọi thứ kéo dài một cách lê thê và mình không biết tại sao lại phải thêm vài phân đoạn đéo hề quan trọng. Tương tự như Newcomer , cách điều tra của quyển này là tìm hiểu kỹ những chi tiết nhỏ, chỉ là cách kể có nhiều góc nhìn - thứ đã khiến diễn biến trở nên xáo trộn. Mình dần dần không còn muốn biết đâu là sự thật trong hai vụ án kia, mà chỉ muốn biết về sự thật mẹ của Kaga.

Khi ở 80% truyện, có một sự thật khiến mình ngạc nhiên, và mình mới hiểu tại sao có một vài người so sách quyển này với Bạch Dạ Hành :))) các tình tiết đươc kết nối hợp lý đi, nhưng để đến được sự ngạc-nhiên-đó thì thật mệt mỏi. Quay đi quay lại tình mẹ con, cha con của quyển này không khiến mình quá cảm động đâu.

Dù đã bắt đầu không còn mê và hứng thú và có dự định sẽ thôi đọc trinh thám, nhưng chắc mình sẽ vẫn chừa một chỗ duy nhất cho các tác phẩm của bác Keigo trong tương lai.

Một câu chuyện thuần trinh thám, đấu trí, truy tìm hung thủ. Tuy vậy Keigo luôn rất biết cách cài cắm những chi tiết nhỏ để khiến mọi thứ có thể thay đổi đến chóng mặt.

Một cái kết mở, không hề dễ dàng để trả lời. Cái hay của Keigo là ở chỗ đó, không hề có những cái kết dễ dàng và người đọc kiểu gì cũng phải tự hỏi bản thân rằng ""Nếu ở trong tình huống đó, mình sẽ phải làm sao đây, để không dẫn tới kết cục mà nhân vật trong sách gặp phải?""",4,28 likes,44

Mình... không thốt nổi nên lời với quyển sách này. Nó vượt quá cả kì vọng của mình.

Nhân vật ""tôi"" không được đề cập đến tên kể qua góc nhìn của cô cuộc điều tra cái chết của người yêu mình. Trước tiên mình cần nói về giọng văn của cuốn sách này. Liên quan đến người yêu nhưng mình không cảm nhận được tình cảm của cô với người yêu mình (là anh Kawadu), cách cô nói về Kawadu có gì đó rất bâng quơ, hờ hững, cái cô hứng thú là điều tra cái chết của anh thôi. Nếu không liên tục lặp lại chữ ""người yêu"" thì khó mà nhận ra mối quan hệ tình cảm của hai nhân vật này. Ngược lại với cách nói thản nhiên, lạnh lùng về người yêu, mối quan hệ thân thiết giữa ""tôi"" và người bạn thân Fuyuko lại thấm đẫm tình cảm. Người đọc dễ dàng cảm nhận được ""tôi"" yêu quý Fuyuko thế nào, và Fuyuko đã quan tâm, chăm sóc ""tôi"" ra sao khi người yêu ""tôi"" chết. Thậm chí, trong suốt quá trình cuộc điều tra, Fuyuko đã giúp đỡ ""tôi"" rất nhiều, cô nhắng nhít, có ích với nhiều mối quan hệ với tư cách là một biên tập viên. Cô đi theo ""tôi"" tới mọi cuộc gặp mặt những nghi phạm tiềm năng, cùng ""tôi"" trải qua những cảm xúc khi nghe tin có án mạng mới.

Về vụ án, mới đầu chưa có gì đặc biệt về cái chết của anh nhà văn Kawadu. Nhưng ""tôi"" dễ dàng tìm ra một đường dây liên hệ anh tới một nghi phạm khác có liên quan, và từ đó là một loạt các nghi phạm xuất hiện, tất cả (kể cả Kawadu) đều có dính líu vào một sự việc nghiêm trọng xảy ra trong quá khứ. Dường như có ai đó đang trừ khử những người liên quan tới vụ việc này. Quan trọng là ""tôi"" phải tìm ra bản chất sự việc đó diễn ra như thế nào, rồi mới biết được kẻ khả nghi nhất là ai. Những chương đầu xảy ra rất chậm rãi, đều đều, giọng văn gần như vô cảm, khách quan, ""tôi"" không đứng ở góc nhìn chủ quan, mặc dù là người kể lại câu chuyện. Cô nhìn nhận sự việc từ nhiều góc độ, phân tích các phương án khả thi và không do dự thực hiện chúng. Cô chắp ghép các manh mối, nhưng đến cuối cùng vẫn còn quá nhiều ẩn số chưa giải thích được.

Đến ba chương cuối, vụ giết người cuối cùng diễn ra. Lúc này, người đọc mới cảm nhận được cảm xúc đau đớn của ""tôi"" qua con chữ. Không còn sự vô cảm, lạnh lùng như trước, mà giọng văn chuyển sang một màu sắc khác, u tối hơn, buồn bã hơn - tuy nhiên sự khách quan vẫn còn đó. Vì tính khách quan nên ""tôi"" không dễ bị sa đà vào quá nhiều tiểu tiết, trừ phi được tiết lộ những chi tiết mang tính sống còn, nhờ một nhân vật không ai ngờ tới (bị đánh giá thấp bởi cả hung thủ). Rồi ai ngờ được, sự thật cuối cùng cũng được lộ ra, bao nhiêu đau thường, mối căm thù bị đưa ra ánh sáng. Về điểm này, hung thủ thật sự, hung thủ cuối cùng giống như một nhân vật bước ra từ trinh thám đen vậy. Trả thù kẻ có tội, nhưng đồng thời tự đưa bản thân vào con đường hủy diệt chính mình.

Mình lấn cấn với những lời thoại không được tự nhiên, có thể do cách viết hồi đó của Keigo chưa được trau chuốt. Thoại tương đối gượng, không mượt mà, không thể hiện được cảm xúc và tính cách nhân vật. Nhân vật nào cũng có thoại tương đối giống nhau. Nhân vật cũng gần giống như vậy. Trừ ""tôi"" và cô bạn Fuyuko và một nhân vật thủ lĩnh khác thì các nhân vật còn lại không có tính cách rõ ràng, xuất hiện mờ nhạt. Ở chương cuối khi ""tôi"" nói hết ra chân tướng sự việc, có hai nhân vật rốt cuộc cũng thể hiện được tính cách đặc sắc của mình.

Nhìn chung, mình rất thích cuốn sách này, cảm giác đọc nó hơi giống Phía sau nghi can X, dù Nghi can X phức tạp vào dày công hơn. Với cuốn này, vụ án chỉ xoay quanh ""tôi"" thôi, nên mình dễ tập trung hơn (với Nghi can X thì vụ án xoay quanh rất nhiều nhân vật nên đôi lúc mình bị lạc lối).",5,18 likes,44

Nếu xét về plot riêng lẻ thì nó ổn, có chút vibe của trinh thám Agatha Christie (cụ thể là Mười người da đen nhỏ kết hợp với tí tẹo Tàu tốc hành phương Đông), nhưng yếu tố để mị cho 2.5 sao là về cách xây dựng nhân vật.

- Nhân vật “tôi” aka người kể chuyện chính aka nữ chính thực sự gây khó ở, nhiều lúc hành động phi logic, đúng kiểu nhân vật trong phim kinh dị cứ thấy mùi nguy hiểm chết người là auto lao đầu vào dù chẳng trang bị vũ khí tự vệ gì. Mặt khác, nhân vật “tôi” này sống...chậm thế bất nào ấy. Cảm giác cô này quá là thờ ơ và vô cảm, thậm chí bất cần đời với việc tính mạng của mình bị đe doạ (định liệt kê một loạt mà thôi thế thành spoil). Tình cảm của cô này đối với anh Kudawa kia cũng không gây ra ấn tượng gì đặc sắc.

- Điều khiến mị cảm thấy khó tả nữa là không biết do cách hành văn này của tác giả hay dịch giả mà đọc cuốn này nó rất ư là... ví dụ ở 105 trang cuối cùng truyện, tớ đếm được cả thảy 44 từ “nhỉ” (chưa tính nửa phần đầu của sách). Kiểu lạm dụng từ “nhỉ” ở cuối câu với tần suất siêu nhiều luôn ấy nên đọc cứ bị khó chịu lol, nó một màu quá thể.

- Nhân vật Shidako cảm thấy bình thường với việc dùng thân thể phụ nữ như một món hàng để trao đổi/trả ơn. Nguyên văn: “[...] Thứ Takemoto yêu cầu để đổi lại tính mạng của bản thân CHỈ LÀ thân thể của một người phụ nữ. [...]”

WTF.

Bỏ qua những điều như cuốn sách này được lấy cảm hứng từ Án mạng trên tàu tốc hành phương Đông của A.C, rằng truyện được Keigo viết rất sớm (1987) dưới dạng kappa novels, thì cuốn này quả thực hội tụ đủ yếu tố là một cuốn trinh thám hay: nội dung logic, thủ phạm và nạn nhân đều không ai có mục đích tốt hay xấu hẳn (nghĩa là rất đời thường), kết thúc hợp lý với hoàn cảnh của truyện, câu cú vừa đủ (không lê thê dài dòng với những đoạn tả cảnh ko cần thiết).
Truyện bắt đầu với cảnh nhân vật tôi - nữ nhà văn trinh thám - được người bạn trai mà cô đang có quan hệ tình cảm buột miệng với cô ""Anh đang bị đưa vào tầm ngắm đấy"". Câu nói tưởng như vu vơ, cuối cùng cái cô nhận được lại là ""Người yêu tôi đã bị người ta vứt ở đó như một đống rác"". Đến khi đó, ""tôi"" mới nhận ra cô không hiểu gì, không biết gì về quá khứ, hiện tại cũng như những mối quan tâm khác của người mà cô đang có quan hệ - khá - gắn - bó. Với ý định biết đâu đây là cơ hội để hiểu thêm về anh, cô - dù không phải cảnh sát hay thám tử - lần dò những manh mối. Từ đó, cô nhận ra đấy không chỉ đơn thuần là tai nạn hay tư thù cá nhân đơn thuần. Đằng sau cái chết của Kawadu- bạn trai cô, là câu chuyện của 11 người, câu chuyện của 1 năm trước. Quá khứ hoá ra chưa bao giờ chịu ngủ yên, như cái bi đông kỷ vật cuối cùng của ai đó.
Mình luôn thích Keigo khi ông viết tập trung vào mặt tối của con người. Với Án mạng 11 chữ, ông đặt các nhân vật vào tình huống khiến hành động của họ khó định đoạt, đánh giá là đúng hay sai, hay thế nào là đúng hơn. Nó chỉ còn đơn giản là lựa chọn tốt nhất mà bản thân họ thấy. Ngay cả từng mối quan hệ được ông đưa ra trong truyện, từ mối quan hệ đầu tiên giữa ""tôi"" - Kawadu - Fuyuko, giữa phu nhân Yumi - giám đốc Yamamori, Shiduko - Kanei - Takemoto, mỗi lựa chọn quan hệ đều chỉ vì mục đích cá nhân, vì ích kỷ của bản thân mà chọn lựa.
Với tiền đề không phân định đúng - sai, tốt - xấu, Keigo cũng mang đến cho người đọc cái kết theo đúng tiến trình đó. Cái kết mà ai cũng có tội, ai cũng vô tội. Ai cũng vừa bị phán xét bởi chính lương tâm, nhưng không ai bị pháp luật sờ gáy, chỉ có toà án cao nhất là cái - chết. Thế mới thấy cái tài của Keigo khi ngay từ đầu truyện ông đã cài câu ""Vì em nghĩ chủ ý sát nhân xét cho cùng cũng giống quan điểm sống thôi"". Vì giống như quan điểm sống, nên nếu quan điểm sống của thủ phạm là việc đó là nên làm thì liệu có phải cứ chọn con đường của sát nhân là sai? Câu trả lời nằm ở quan điểm của mỗi người đọc, đó là thứ Keigo luôn dành tặng cho độc giả trong mỗi truyện của ông.
Tất nhiên, xét về trinh thám, truyện không quá bất ngờ. Người đọc dễ nhận ra mánh khoé, cũng như ai là hung thủ khá sớm. Điểm cộng là truyện ngắn, câu từ được ông dùng ngắn gọn, đi vào trọng tâm. Các tình tiết không dư thừa khiến nhịp truyện tránh rườm rà. Do truyện dễ đoán nên cũng không nhiều cú twist khiến người đọc bất ngờ, nhưng khiến truyện mang phong vị của trinh thám cổ điển. Việc miêu tả cách sống đơn độc, khá bàng quan của người Nhật cũng góp phần vào tính chặt chẽ của truyện.
Trên tất cả, dù là truyện trinh thám nhưng Keigo vẫn đem vào đó những bài học về lựa chọn, về lối sống, và ""Dù ngày mai có xảy ra chuyện gì, thì hôm nay cứ đi ngủ cái đã""",3,2 likes,44

Hung thủ là người bị hại, người bị hại lại là hung thủ. Và những câu hỏi mở cho độc giả: đâu là đúng? đâu là sai? đâu là thiện? đâu là ác?
Tuy nhiên, tác phẩm này có một cái gì đó làm mình chưa đã, khi nhân vật phản diện đứng sau tất cả được đẩy lên cao đến nghẹt thở ở những trang cuối, rồi cuối cùng được thả lững lờ ở một cái kết mở. Mình muốn nhìn rõ hơn tâm địa và toan tính của ông này. Nhưng có lẽ do tác giả xây dựng những nhân vật then chốt khá kỹ ở đoạn đầu, nên khúc sau khá dễ dàng đoán ra, thậm chí câu chốt cuối cùng cũng quá hiển nhiên chứ không gây sốc như ở những tác phẩm khác. Ngoài ra các nhân vật phụ trong chuyến đi cứ xà quần với nhau làm mình nhầm lẫn lên không phân biệt được ai với ai.",4,1 like,44

review_3696671867,Iry,"Dec 17, 2020","Nạn nhân là hung thủ, hung thủ lại là nạn nhân?
Là tai nạn, nhưng lại là ngộ sát? Là ngộ sát, nhưng lại là cố ý giết người?
Một người nhưng lại chết 2 lần?
Là lợi dụng? Không, là thật tâm? Nhưng vẫn lợi dụng?

Thật sự thì đối với mình “Án mạng mười một chữ” không quá ấn tượng sau khi mình đã đọc qua các tác phẩm khác của Keigo cũng như những tác phẩm trinh thám khác. Đối với mình quyển này khá đơn giản, thuần trinh thám. Và với một đứa đã đọc qua nhiều truyện trinh thám như mình thì theo motif này đoán ra hung thủ là ai từ ⅓ quyển không khó, dù bản thân cũng chẳng có suy luận hay bằng chứng gì. Tình tiết và twist, tâm lý nhân vật và những khúc chiết trong đó không quá phức tạp. Tuy nhiên không thể vì vậy mà đánh giá thấp quyển này vì chính mình cũng không ngờ lại bị cuốn vào như vậy. Mở ra đọc thì phải đọc một lèo đến hết chẳng muốn dừng lại. Cứ phải tò mò tiếp theo sẽ xảy ra chuyện gì? Ai sẽ là nạn nhân tiếp theo? Hung thủ có phải như mình đoán không? Cứ thế cứ thế mà đeo đuổi theo từng con chữ đến hết truyện rồi lại phải tự lẩm nhẩm “Chậc, đúng là Keigo”.
Điểm chung ở các tác phẩm của Keigo mà mình đã đọc đó là đến cuối truyện, bạn ít khi nào có thể chỉ trách mà không thương hung thủ, chỉ thương mà không trách nạn nhân. Thậm chí ai là nạn nhân ai là hung thủ cũng chẳng thể nói rõ. Về tình về lý ai cũng có cái đúng và ai cũng có cái sai. Và vẫn là những cái kết bi thương nhưng lại xuất sắc và gợi nhớ nhất có thể, nếu khác đi thì chẳng còn hấp dẫn đến thế. Ở các tác phẩm tượng đài như Phía sau nghi can X, Bạch Dạ Hành, Bí mật của Naoko cũng thế, và ở quyển này cũng thế.

Thế đấy, đối với Án mạng mười một chữ, mình không đánh giá quá cao, nhưng mình thích quyển này, thật sự rất thích. Cơ mà thích nhất vẫn là câu kết của quyển sách: “Dù ngày mai có xảy ra chuyện gì, thì hôm nay cứ đi ngủ cái đã.” Đi ngủ thôi :)))))",4,1 like,44

เคโงะยังทำให้ตื่นเต้นได้เหมือนเดิม อ่านเพลินจนจบรวมเดียวได้ในเวลา 3 ชั่วโมง ด้วยการดำเนินเรื่องที่ตื่นเต้น สูสีระหว่างหญิงนักเขียนผู้ตามสืบเรื่องเหตุการณ์และคนร้าย เกือบจะไล่กันทันแต่ก็ทิ้งห่างไปได้อีกก้าว อ่านสนุก ลุ้นและเอาใจช่วยคุณนักเขียนหญิงของเรามากๆ ในขณะเดียวกันก็คาดเดาความจริงอะไรไม่ได้ เรื่องดำเนินไปแบบค่อยๆ ปล่อยให้เรารู้มากขึ้นทีละนิด แต่ไม่มากพอที่จะทำฝห้เราเดาทุกอย่างออก และตอนจบก็บอกได้เลยว่าเกินคาด พลิกไปพลิกมา เข้าใจว่าเข้สใจแล้วแต่ก็ยังมีความจริงในความจริงในความจริงไป 3 ตลบ จบแบบประทับใจ เป็นเรื่องที่อ่านจบแล้วได้คำตอบครบถ้วนในเรื่องของเหตุการณ์ แต่กลับเกิดคำถามในเรื่องมนุษยธรรมและความเป็นมนุษย์ สุดๆ ข้อเสียคือคนเยอะไปหน่อย 😅 จำชื่อไม่ค่อยได้เลยจ้า

review_3694379393,Thanawat,"Jan 31, 2021","สนุกมาก เป็น sci-fi + suspense ที่เจ๋งมาก นอกจากนี้ยังบีบคั้นอารมณ์ด้วยดราม่าของเรื่องที่ยากจะจินตนาการถึง

นิยายสืบสวนสอบสวน ฝีมือระดับเทพของเคโงะเล่มนี้ แม้จะหนาเกือบสี่ร้อยหน้า แต่ก็เล่นงานคนอ่านซะอยู่หมัด อ่านจบในรวดเดียว

การตรวจดีเอ็นเอเพื่อการพิสูจน์บุคคลตามวิธีการปัจจุบัน ต้องอาศัยตัวอย่าง อย่างน้อยสองชุด นำมาถอดรหัสออกมาเป็นรหัสดีเอ็นเอ แล้วนำมาเทียบกัน ถ้าเหมือนกันก็บอกได้ว่าเป็นตัวอย่างที่มาจากแหล่งเดียวกัน

เรื่องเปิดขึ้นด้วยการ introduce เทคโนโลยีระดับเทพ ที่สามารถถอดรหัสดีเอ็นเอออกมาเป็นรูปพรรณสันฐาน ในระดับที่ระบุรูปร่างหน้าตารวมทั้งนิสัยใจคอได้ แถมยิ่งถ้ามี pool ของดีเอ็นเอในประชากรทั่วไปอยู่มาก จะสามารถบอกได้ถึงขั้นว่าดีเอ็นเอที่ได้มาเป็นของใคร ญาติพี่น้องคือใคร โดยไม่ต้องเอาดีเอ็นเอของคนๆ นั้นมาเปรียบเทียบเลยด้วยซ้ำ ซึ่งมันไปไกลกว่าเทคโนโลยีปัจจุบัน (เท่าที่เปิดเผยต่อสาธารณชน)

แน่นอนว่ามันมีประโยชน์มากในการตามหาอาชญากร และตัวเอกของเรื่องก็คิดเช่นนั้น ในฐานะผู้พัฒนาเทคโนโลยีนี้

“Not found”
เทคโนโลยีระดับเทพ แต่ปรากฏว่าดันมีช่องว่าง ที่ค้นหาอาชญากรจำนวนหนึ่งไม่เจอ จึงเป็นที่มาของเรื่อง ประกอบกับพี่น้องอัจฉริยะ “ผู้สร้าง” เทคโนโลยีนี้ ถูกฆ่าตายพร้อมๆ กัน เลยต้องอาศัยฝีมือสืบสวนสอบสวนจากตำรวจอีกคนควบคู่ไปด้วย

ดราม่ามันมาบังเกิด เพราะเมื่อใช้เทคโนโลยีถอดรหัสดีเอ็นเอเสร็จ รูปที่ถ่ายทอดออกมาดันเป็นตัวเอกซะนี่ แต่ช่วงเวลาที่เกิดฆาตกรรม ตัวเอกกำลัง “หลับ” เพราะเป็นช่วงเวลาที่ “อีกบุคลิกหนึ่ง” กำลัง “ตื่น” อยู่

เคโงะบิวด์ให้คนอ่านเกิดความสงสัยเชื่อครึ่งไม่เชื่อครึ่งว่า “อีกบุคลิกหนึ่ง” อาจจะเป็นฆาตกรซะเองก็ได้

สนุกมาก
ทั้งการใช้เรื่องของดีเอ็นเอ ร่วมกับเรื่องสองบุคลิก มาเป็นแกนตรึงคนอ่านเอาไว้ ร่วมกับการผูกโยง เบื้องลึกเบื้องหลังสุดซับซ้อนตามสไตล์ ทำให้เปิดอ่านรวดเดียวจนจบ ยิ่งตอนเฉลยราวๆ สามสิบหน้าสุดท้ายยิ่งสนุก

นอกจากนี้ยังใส่ประเด็นทางสังคมอันแสนเจ็บปวดเอาไว้ในส่วนที่เรียกว่า “platinum data” ที่ทำให้เห็นว่าข้อมูลหรือความเป็นส่วนตัว (privacy) จะถูกคุมเข้มหรือถูกเปิดเผยได้เพียงใดนั้น มันขึ้นอยู่กับว่าเป็นข้อมูลของใคร ความไม่เท่าเทียมแม้ในความเป็นส่วนตัว มันขึ้นอยู่กับว่า “รัฐ” มองว่าเจ้าของข้อมูลเป็นใคร

ต้องบอกว่าส่วนตัว รู้สึกว่าบางส่วนของเรื่อง ใน concept เรื่องการทำนายตัวอาชญากร คล้ายกับหนังเรื่อง The minority report แต่ส่วนอื่นๆ นั้นจัดเต็มตามแบบฉบับเคโงะ",4,15 likes,45

แก่นเรื่องหลักเป็นเรื่องการเก็บข้อมูล DNA ของทุกคนไว้ส่วนกลาง เพื่อไว้สืบหาฆาตกรเมื่อเกิดคดีฆาตกรรม ฟังดูเฉยๆนะ เพราะเป็นเรื่องคุ้นหูคุ้นตาอยู่บ้างแล้ว แต่ชอบรายละเอียดเล็กๆ ที่สอดแทรกไว้ในเรื่อง เป็นเรื่องที่เราไม่เคยคิด แต่พออ่านแล้วก็ว้าววว
- สิทธิส่วนบุคคลมีจุดแบ่งอยู่ตรงไหนถ้าสามารถเข้าถึงข้อมูลได้ขนาดนี้
- จะปกป้องข้อมูลไม่ให้ใช้ในทางที่ผิดได้อย่างไร
- การลดหย่อนภาษีให้คนมาเก็บตัวอย่าง DNA คล้ายๆวิธีแจกเงินบ้านเราเลยแฮะ
- อภิสิทธิ์ชน ที่รอดพ้นจากการตรวจสอบของระบบ

review_4440019248,Thuỷ Sún,"Jan 03, 2022","** spoiler alert ** ""Dữ liệu bạch kim"" lấy bối cảnh một tương lai không xa, khi Nhật Bản phát triển thành công công nghệ điều tra bằng DNA. Công nghệ này đã bộc lộ rõ hiệu quả của nó khi mà giúp giảm tỉ lệ tố cáo nghi phạm sai xuống 0%, đồng thời tăng tỉ lệ bắt đúng tội phạm lên con số 100% đẹp đẽ.

Asama Reiji, vị cảnh sát khi nhìn thấy khả năng của công nghệ này đã ngay lập tức có quan ngại về tính hợp pháp và ảnh hưởng của nó đến cuộc sống của người dân. Do rằng mẫu DNA điều tra là được lấy một cách bất hợp pháp.

Tuy nhiên Kagura, người có nhân cách thứ hai là Ryu và là người phát triển công nghệ DNA này lại rất tin tưởng vào những gì anh ta đang làm. Đồng thời chính anh cũng khẳng định rằng công nghệ này sẽ sớm hợp pháp, và Asama không có gì phải lo.

Cho đến một ngày Kagura phải chạy trốn khỏi cảnh sát vì chính cái hệ thống anh làm ra kia là thứ đã tố cáo anh. Mang tội danh giết người, Kagura đã tự mình làm rõ chân tướng để minh oan cho bản thân. Sự thật đằng sau hệ thống điều tra DNA và Dữ liệu bạch kim là Mogul.

Not Found 13 Minakami đã thần thánh hoá DNA lên, xem nó như là một thước đo chuẩn mực của con người. Kagura trước đây cũng có thể coi một phần là giống như cô được, vì anh cũng từng tôn thờ DNA, xem nó như chìa khoá để mở cửa tiến vào một con người, điều tra và giải mã họ. Lý tưởng này một phần có thể coi là đúng. Vì DNA có quyết định rất nhiều điểm về một con người như là giới tính, ngoại hình,… tuy nhiên có một thứ nó không thể quyết định, Minakami cũng đã mù quáng mà bỏ qua. Đó chính là bản chất và số phận của con người. Thứ mà chỉ có hành động và việc làm của bản thân người đó mới có thể quyết định. Chính Kagura lúc về cuối phim mới nhận ra được điều đó, khi nhìn qua Ryu và anh. Cùng một cơ thể, cùng một DNA nhưng bản chất và số phận của cả hai thì hoàn toàn đối lập.",4,3 likes,45

review_4584662876,Nguyet Minh,"Mar 03, 2022","Màu trinh thám trong “Dữ liệu bạch kim” của Keigo khá giống trinh thám kiểu Mỹ. Ở đây, yếu tố tâm lý nhân vật không còn được mổ xẻ nhiều, thay vào đó yếu tố hành động. Trạng thái tức thời của các nhân vật đi đôi với những hành động cụ thể kéo tiết tấu truyện nhanh hơn, tính hiện đại và tính công nghệ được phát huy nhiều hơn. Chính vì vậy, ta bắt gặp một màu sắc rất mới lạ so với các tác phẩm khác của Keigo.

Những vụ án giết người liền nhau, việc truy tìm dấu vết hung thủ được triển khai bằng hệ thống DNA. Đó là một bước tiến cho các cuộc điều tra trong tương lai khi mà tỉ lệ bỏ sót tội phạm có khả năng là 0%. Nhưng đó cũng đồng nghĩa với việc quyền riêng tư của con người trong bảo mật DNA bị xâm phạm khi mà chính quyền âm thầm thu thập DNA của công dân từ các bệnh viện. Tội phạm, thậm chí người nhà của tội phạm cũng bị ảnh hưởng ít nhiều. Bởi vì kết quả phân tích của Viện nghiên cứu phân tích đặc biệt đáng tin cậy, “việc điều tra dựa vào hệ thống DNA đã giúp bắt giữ vài tội phạm, ngoại hình hay tính cách của hung thủ hoàn toàn trùng khớp với thông tin mà hệ thống đưa ra, không có ngoại lệ nào.”

Vụ án NF13 ( Not Found 13 ) do Asama phụ trách cứ vừa kín lại vừa mở. Những nghi ngờ của anh hoàn toàn có cơ sở nhưng nguyên nhân cốt lõi thì vô cùng mờ mịt, thậm chí bị xoay vòng tại chỗ. Vụ ám sát anh em nhà Tateshina vô tình mở ra quá nhiều bí mật không ngờ. Kagura Ryuhei - một nhân viên phân tích thuộc viện nghiên cứu chính là sợi chỉ xuyên suốt của vụ án đặc biệt này. Theo dõi để thấy rằng, muốn phá án, ngoài chuyên môn, ngoài dữ liệu, ta còn đòi hỏi cả những bí mật của cơ quan điều tra phải được chia sẻ công bằng và thành thật, nếu không, mọi thứ sẽ lạc hướng. Tệ hơn nữa là sự hy sinh, trả giá trong đội ngũ điều tra ấy sẽ phải xảy đến.

Truyện còn mở ra một lĩnh vực ta bắt gặp nhiều gần đây trong xã hội hiện đại, đó là chứng đa nhân cách. Không diễn giải triệt để lắm về biểu hiện của nó như Sidney Sheldon từng làm như trong “Hãy kể giấc mơ của em”, nhưng cũng đủ để hiểu chứng đa nhân cách đã hủy hoại tinh thần và điều khiển con người nguy hiểm đến thế nào! “Ảo giác”, “xung điện”, “thuốc hoán đổi” là những từ ngữ ta bắt gặp thường xuyên khi theo dõi cuộc điều tra. Và ta cũng sẽ thấy công cuộc nghiên cứu của một số nhà khoa học là vô cùng điên rồ và vị kỷ. Chất điên rồ ấy đi đôi với tài năng nhưng cũng là thứ vũ khí nguy hiểm tiềm ẩn, dễ biến họ thành kẻ dị biệt và hủy diệt trong vỏ bọc lỗi lạc, đam mê cống hiến.

Truyện không mới lạ trong một đại dương tiểu thuyết trinh thám khắp đó đây nhưng độc đáo và mới lạ so với chính Keigo. Chất Keigo dường như cũng đang được đa nhân cách hoá. Thế nên, ta vẫn thấy sự thông minh, đa tài, khéo léo xoay chuyển qua mỗi tác phẩm.",4,,45

รหัสลับพันธุกรรมฆาตกร เป็นนิยายไซไฟแอ็คชั่นธริลเลอร์ เป็นไซไฟเล่มที่อ่านง่ายที่สุดแล้วของคุณเคโงะ เทียบกับรักในโลกพิศวง มนุษย์ตุ๊กตาแล้ว

เล่มนี้คือเข้าใจง่ายมาก ลำดับเรื่องติดตามง่าย ไม่มีจังหวะที่เรารู้สึกโง่ระหว่างอ่านเลยค่ะ... คือไม่ต้องเปิดโหมดปล่อยเบลอศัพท์ยากเวลาอ่านเลย อ่านสบายๆ

ตอนอ่าน 60 หน้าแรกก็ตกใจว่า คุณเคโงะอธิบายเรื่องซับซ้อนอย่างพันธุกรรมกับการจัดการข้อมูลปริมาณมหาศาลมาให้เราเข้าใจง่ายๆ แบบนี้เลยได้ไงกันนะ?

ใจนึงก็คิดว่า เราไม่ใช่แฟนไซไฟ สายแอ็คชั่นก็ไม่ค่อยอ่านด้วย เล่มนี้มันคงมีจังหวะเบื่อบ้างล่ะ... โอยยย ไม่จ้ะๆๆๆ เล่มนี้นี่คือเทียบชั้นแอ็คชั่นธริลเลอร์เล่มโปรดตลอดกาลของเราอย่าง 'แผนอำพราง' ของ อะกิมิตซึ ทาคากิได้สบายเลย

อ่านจนจบก็จะรู้สึกเหมือนเอา digital fotress ของแดน บราวน์มายำรวมกับ 'แผนอำพราง' อ่านแล้วลุ้นมาก แต่มีช่วงสโลว์ดาวน์มาตัดอารมณ์คุกรุ่นได้แบบกำลังพอดี

สงสารพระเอกที่ต้องหนีหัวซุกหัวซุน ทำไมอยู่ดีๆ ตัวเองก็กลายมาเป็นผู้ต้องสงสัย ต้องหนีๆๆๆ พร้อมกับสืบ 2 เรื่องไปพร้อมกัน

ชอบที่คุณเคโงะหยิบเรื่องคนมีหลายบุคลิกมาใช้ได้อย่างเท่และเก๋มาก เป็นการใช้ประโยชน์ของโรคนี้ในรูปแบบที่เราไม่เคยอ่านเจอจากเรื่องอื่น

เดาคนร้ายถูก 555 แต่ก็ไม่ได้้เดายากอะไร ชอบที่เรื่องนี้มีการพลิกกลับไปกลับมาว่าเชื่อใจใครได้ เชื่อใจใครไม่ได้กันแน่

review_4682890492,Minh Trang,"Apr 30, 2022","Bữa mình có đọc được review của 1 bạn, bạn nói cuốn này bác Keigo viết giống như trinh thám Mỹ, cụ thể là giống với Sidney Sheldon. Mà trong truyện của cụ Sheldon thì như nào nhỉ, cứ ai có nhiều thông tin hữu ích nhất, có được sự tin tưởng của nhân vật chính nhất, thì chắc cú đó chính là hung thủ, là trùm cuối xấu xa 🤣

Khi đọc về vụ lấy mẫu ADN toàn dân, mình đã thoáng có ý nghĩ ""nếu như vậy thì đâu còn gì để bảo vệ được cho giới cầm quyền, họ lại tự đẩy bản thân vào tình huống bất lợi vậy sao?"". Nhưng hóa ra họ đã sớm có sự chuẩn bị cho mình rồi, chính là ""dữ liệu bạch kim"". Hmm, lại thêm một điểm giống trinh thám Mỹ rồi nè, vì động cơ liên quan tới chính trị, tới những kẻ bất chấp thủ đoạn để bảo vệ cho địa vị của mình.

Nhìn chung thì Dữ liệu bạch kim hơi lạ hơn những cuốn sách khác của Keigo tiên sinh, nhưng vẫn là một câu chuyện khá thú vị.

Trong câu chuyện này, chúng ta sẽ đồng hành cùng thanh tra Asama để tìm kiếm Dữ liệu bạch kim và truy ra NF13 chính là kẻ nào?

Một lần nữa, sau quyển Biến Thân, chứng bệnh liên quan đến não được tác giả mang vào nội dung truyện, điều này mình thích hơn cả điều tra phá án. Bên cạnh đó, cuộc điều tra truy lùng NF13 cũng làm người đọc hồi hộp theo dõi, mình định rate 4* nhưng càng mong chờ thì đến đoạn cuối lúc đấu nhau với NF13, có chi tiết mà mình không thể chịu được, nên giảm còn 3* vậy.",3,0 likes,45

Normalmente puedo leer en pedacitos y luego seguir con lo que estoy haciendo... pero este libro me atrapo desde los primeros capítulos! No podía dejarlo!

Platina Data es un libro escrito originalmente en japonés y el cual no ha sido oficialmente traducido al ingles, menos al español. Pero una persona en internet se propuso el proyecto de traducirlo y compartirlo para quienes quisiéramos leer la historia original.

Digo original, porque ya hay una película de este libro y aunque es de mucha acción, el libro te mantiene atado a la historia y muchos detalles explicados en el tienen mucho mas sentido de como los mencionan en la película.

Le quite medio punto, porque no estoy de acuerdo con los sobornos y encubrimientos... pero es una triste realidad en todo el mundo... así que ni modo, así era la historia!

SUPER RECOMENDABLE! (aunque difícil de conseguir)

review_4780762597,Maru,"Jun 14, 2022","Có hai câu chuyện mà tôi thấy thú vị.
Một là nhân cách mà Kagura tạo ra để bảo vệ mình.
Hai là ý tưởng về cách các chính trị gia thao túng thế giới, đảm bảo các giai cấp vẫn ở nguyên vị trí của họ. Không tệ.
Nhưng ấn tượng nhất là Suzuran. Đến lần t2 cô xuất hiện tôi đã nhận ra rồi, nhưng đoán hơi chệch một chút khi nghiêng về 1 nhân cách khác.
Tôi nghĩ HK đã hơi ôm đồm. Nếu ông tập trung vào ý tưởng số hai, và đưa nó thành cuộc chiến về công lý thì tôi sẽ ấn tượng hơn. Có quá ít góc nhìn được đề cập, nên bất giác trở nên hơi nhạt.",3,0 likes,45

Trong thế giới công nghệ phát triển, việc thu thập dữ liệu lớn về ADN của người dân là 1 chủ đề đã được nghĩ đến và gây tranh luận với những ưu-khuyết điểm của nó. Câu truyện này nhấn vào đó để khai thác những diễn biến có thể xảy ra trong xã hội ấy - kiểm soát người dân bằng ADN nhưng lại chừa lỗ hổng cho những người có chức quyền. Để ta thấy rằng, dù công nghệ có phát triển như thế nào thì điều tạo ra tội ác lẫn hạnh phúc vẫn đến từ đôi tay và trái tim của con người. Một tâm hồn tăm tối thì bàn tay sẽ càng đẫm máu với sự che chở của công nghệ, ngược lại, hạnh phúc sẽ đến với những ai cố gắng giải mã thông điệp từ những bất hạnh.",3,0 likes,45

東野圭吾作品は読みやすいし、本と本の間の息抜きにちょうどいいので読んでみた。
あっという間に読める「ミステリ作家」に焦点を当てた作品が8作品。
どれも短いが、題名から連想するような「殺人」はあまり起きない。(起きる時もある)
どちらかというと、東野圭吾本人の体験が元になってるんだろうな、と思われる、ブラックユーモアとSOSが混じったような作品が多い。
例えば、税金対策で経費でおとす為に作品の内容を犠牲にする作家、昨今の世の中の「理系」への挑戦、物語の中に物語があって気が抜けない作品、本業界(読者や作家)の高齢化の話、模倣殺人とその裏側(これは確かにミステリっぽかった)、やたらめったら長い事を売りにする本への批判的作品、ミステリ作家へのプレッシャーの話、そして、書評家等本を読むことを生業としている人の苦悩と手抜き:全て機械にやらせるようになっている世の中への警鐘:ミステリの中に蘊蓄ばかり盛り込んで内容や人物描写はスカスカな作品（私は高田崇史のQEDシリーズを思い浮かべてしまった）に対する皮肉が詰まった作品、等、ミステリをよく読む人間としてはクスっと笑えるけれど考えさせられるものも多かった。

けれど、物語として凄く面白い！！！というわけではないので、平均点の星３つ。

Most victims were female, some of them died just because they were wearing some uniforms. Also, there was a character who works as an in-home secretary. Other characters immediately assumed that she was her boss’s love interest or something, which was just really awkward if you think about it.

review_1635229274,Sophie,"May 11, 2016","The first book of Higashino's ""Tantei Galileo"" series consists of five short stories that all deal with strange phenomena. In order to solve the cases the leading detective, Kusanagi, has to resort to his friend Yukawa for help, a physics professor. The cases are interesting; and even though they read very construed that doesn't make them any less interesting, somehow. Kusanagi and Yukawa are a fun team, although Kusanagi does come across as very... well. Let's assume he's really good at solving cases that don't have to do with strange phenomena.

What Higashino is really good at is making the reader like or dislike a character in a matter of seconds. Since I was already manipulated by him once I probably paid a little more attention to it than I usually would, but he really does it well. The first story especially was very difficult in that regard because you cannot help like the perpetrator.

Since Yukawa is a physics professor it makes sense that there is quite a bit of physics related vocab, but I am happy to say I handled that quite well. What was difficult were the names without furigana - I admit most of the time I made a reading up because I am very bad at names.

While I don't feel the necessity to order all other books by him, now, I definitely intend to read more by him when I'm in the mood for mysteries.",4,1 like,48

Совсем другого я ожидала от этой книги, получила же нечто очень-очень средненькое. Во-первых, это не роман, а сборник коротких новелл, объединённых одной темой и главными действующими лицами. Даже персонажами их не назовёшь. Писались эти новеллы, по-моему, совсем не как детективы. В основе каждого рассказа какой-то опыт из экспериментальной физики. То есть вот проведён лабораторный эксперимент, в результате которого что-то загорелось, взорвалось или свернулось в дугу. Писатель думает: «Круто! А как с помощью этого всего можно убить человека?» Вот так создаётся убийство.

А далее детектив Кусанаги идёт в институт к своему другу физику Югаве за помощью. Таким образом, Югава отвечает за научную часть расследования. И здесь вопросов нет, ведь ноги всех историй растут именно отсюда. А вот Кусанаги, отвечающий за криминальную часть расследования… О, это отдельный разговор. Он всегда «случайно» видит, как подозреваемый встречается с человеком, который потом… Или «случайно» оказывается в школьном музее как раз в тот момент, когда туда заходят две дамы и опознают в экспонате лицо брата, который… Или «случайно» находит в квартире убитого старый чек из кафе, находящегося рядом с местом преступления. А знает об этом Кусанаги, потому что «случайно» именно там живут его родственники. В общем, понятно.

Если резюмировать, то:
а) научная составляющая местами интересна, хотя не особо развёрнута в рамках столь малого формата и не всегда до конца ясна;
б) детективная составляющая удручает немыслимым количеством «случайностей»;
в) собственно, литературная ценность, язык - весьма незамысловат;
г) персонажи совершенно плоские, помимо основного рода их занятий мы знаем только, что Югава играет в бадминтон и не любит детей, а Кусанаги невероятно удачлив на «случайные» совпадения, им по тридцать четыре года, оба не женаты.

- А ты по-прежнему терпеть не можешь детей?
- Дети – нерациональные существа. А общение с нерациональным собеседником действует мне на нервы.
- Если так, то и с женщинами общение тебе противопоказано.
- Многие женщины мыслят вполне логично. Во всяком случае, таких не меньше, чем нерационально мыслящих мужчин.",3,0 likes,48
review_3050883279,Allison,"Aug 12, 2021","Fun to see how Higashino began his main detective character. Some short stories were better than others, and the mysteries all hinged on some type of chemical trick so that the professor's expertise could be put to use.

I had two major issues with this collection. First was the over-reliance on Dr. Yukawa's reveal. As a reader, there were very few opportunities to ""beat"" the detective because we weren't always privy to the same information he had. Second, most of the female characters in this were purposefully written to be unintelligent, gold diggers, or ""nagging"" housewives. There was one sequence that was meant to be funny where a police officer lets his imagination run wild that a murder victim was involved in a torrid affair... only to be basically proven right at the conclusion. I know from reading some of Higashino's later works that his characters aren't always sexist, but many of the conversations felt dated at best. (Though I will say that many of the male characters are quite stereotyped and dislikable as well, so it might just be Higashino trying to add splashes of hard-boiled tropes into his stories.)

I would only recommend it to those who want to read the first collection of stories where Dr. Yukawa appears, not to general mystery fans.",3,0 likes,48

""กาลิเลโอ"" เป็นชื่อนักวิทยาศาสตร์ระดับบิดาตัวจริง ที่เป็นไปด้วยงานบุคเบิกด้านวิทยาศาสตร์ ฟิสิกส์ และดาราศาสตร์
ซึ่งชื่อ ""กาลิเลโอ"" นี้ เป็นชื่อที่ตำรวจตั้งฉายาให้ ""ยุกาวะ มานาบุ"" อาจารย์ฟิสิกส์หนุ่มมหาวิทยาลัยเทโตะ ที่ใช้พลังของตรรกะและวิทยาศาสตร์คลี่คลายคดีที่ไม่สามารถอธิบายได้ด้วยสามัญสำนึกธรรมดาๆ

ปฐมบทของซีรีย์เล่มนี้เป็นรวมเรื่องสั้น 5 เรื่อง ที่พาไปรู้จัก ""ยุกาวะ"" กับตำรวจเพื่อนสนิท ที่มาไหว้วานให้ช่วยสืบคดีพิศวง แปลกประหลาดให้

เรื่องสั้นทั้ง 5 เรื่อง ได้แก่
- ลุกไหม้
- คัดลอก
- เน่าเปื่อย
- จุดระเบิด
- หลุดลอย
ซึ่งทั้ง 5 เรื่องมีจุดร่วมกันคือการเกิดคดีที่แทบจะหลุดไปจากสามัญสำนึกคนธรรมดา

จริงๆ แล้ว ความเทพของยุกาวะ ก็คือความเทพของ Keigo นั่นแหละ

เป็นงานสืบสวนสอบสวน ที่ใช้หลักวิทยาศาสตร์เท่ห์ๆ มาอธิบาย

ก็เลยหยิบเล่มนี้มาเพราะเป็นรวมเรื่องสั้น อ่านแปีปๆก็จบตอนละ แต่......

เริ่มอ่านตอนแรกวันที่ 6 มิถุนายน ตอน ลุกไหม้
พออ่านจบก็ตัดสินใจหยุดอ่านเล่มนี้ไว้ก่อน เพราะค่อนข้างผิดหวัง คือมันธรมมดาไปหน่อยสำหรับเรา
เพราะทั้งตัวนักเขียนและซีรี่ีส์เรื่องนี้คนชื่นชมกันเยอะมาก จนเราเกิดความคาดหวัง
แต่ตอน ลุกไหม้ที่เราอ่านมันธรรมดามาก จุดที่เป็นสาเหตุของการลุกไหม้เราก็ดเดาๆได้ตั้งแต่ต้น

หลังจากวางเล่มนี้ลงเราก็ไปหยิบคดีฆาตกรรมเจ้าหยิงสโว์ไวท์ มาอ่าน ซึ่งสนุกใช้ได้เลย
เข้าเรื่องต่อ

แต่หลังจากที่เราอ่านเล่มนู้นเล่มนี้ไปแล้ว ก็ถึงเวลามาสะสางตอนอื่นๆในเล่มให้มันจบ
มีอีก 4 ตอนที่เหลือคือ

คดีที่ 2 คัดลอก
อันนี้ค่อนข้างเฉยๆ แต่ก็ชอบตรงที่มีความเป็นนิบายบสืบสวนแบบดั้งเดิม และพตอนท้ายๆที่ทิ้งปมไว้ว่ามันคือผลพลงจากวิทยาศาสตรืหรือผี

คดีที่ 3 เน่าเปื่อย
อันนี้ก็พออ่านได้

คดีที่ 4 จุดระเบิด
อันนี้ชอบนะ ซับซ้อนดี ทำเป็นตอนยาวก็น่าจะรุ่ง

คดีที่ 5 หลุดลอย
ตอนนี้ค่อนข้างเฉยๆและด้วยความโง่วิทย์ของเราทำให้ไม่สามารถจินตนาการถึงวธีการเห็นภาพจากที่ไกลๆของเด็กในเรื่องได้
พอมาดูในซีรี่ส์ก็ยังงงอยู่ดี 5555


สรุป

พออ่านได้ ไม่ได้ชอบมากมาย คงพราะมันเป็นแค่ตอนสั้นๆที่ไม่สามารถใส่รายละเอียดความละเมียดละไมอะไรเข้ามาได้

5 เรื่องราวชีวิต
5 แรงจูงใจ

ยอดนักสืบ “คางะ” เป็นผู้คลี่คลายคดี
ทุกเรื่อง ทุกฆาตกรรม ล้วนจบในตอนไม่เกี่ยวข้องกัน
ทุกเรื่อง จะเปิดด้วยดราม่าชีวิตของคนที่เหลืออยู่ และเชื่อว่าคอสืบสวนสอบสวนจะพอเดาตัวฆาตกรได้ แต่นั่นไม่ได้ทำให้ความสนุกน่าติดตามลดลงแต่อย่างใด
เพราะสิ่งที่คนอ่านจะเดาไม่ออกเลยคือวิธีการฆ่า (how) และแรงจูงใจ (why)

ดราม่าความสัมพันธ์ที่เป็นเหตุจูงใจให้ฆ่าในเล่มนี้ จริงๆ แล้วก็เป็นดราม่าที่เจอได้ทั่วไป แต่ Keigo นำรายละเอียดปลีกย่อยเรื่องความสัมพันธ์ใส่เข้ามา จนอ่านเพลิน ไม่เบื่อหรือรู้สึกว่า “เอ ซ้ำนะ” แต่อย่างใด

ตำรวจนักสืบ “คางะ” ในซีรีย์นี้มีบุคลิกแบบว่าเท่ สุภาพ และฉลาดเป็นกรด
ใช้พลังแห่งการสังเกต และการไล่ตามสืบส่วนที่เกี่ยวข้องทุกอย่าง แม้แต่เรื่องเล็กๆ น้อยๆ พี่แกก็ไปตามเก็บ จนนำมาปะติดปะต่อจนได้คำตอบในที่สุด

เรื่องที่ชอบที่สุดคือเรื่องสุดท้าย ไม่มีใครตาย แต่เนื้อเรื่องมันเดินได้บีบหัวใจดีแท้ ทั้งๆ ที่มีแค่บทสนทนาระหว่าง “คางะ” กับ “เหยื่อ” แต่กลับลากพาอารมณ์คนอ่านไปใกล้ชิดกับอารมณ์ใจคอของตัวละคร ที่สำคัญคือ เหตุผลที่ “คางะ” ตะลุยว่าใครเป็นคนวางแผนฆ่า ทั้งหมดนั้นทำไปเพราะ “มิตรภาพระหว่างเพื่อน”

หนังสือชุดนี้ ถ้าใครเคยอ่านการ์ตูนมังงะโคนันจะรู้เลยว่าตอนเฉลยจะคล้ายกันมาก เพราะพ่อตำรวจนักสืบจะทำให้สุดท้ายฆาตกรก็ “หลุดว่าฆ่า” หลุดปากยอมรับออกมาเองว่าฆ่าอย่างไร และฆ่าทำไม

เวทมนตร์ของ Keigo จะตรึงคุณเอาไว้จนอ่านรวดเดียวจบเล่ม
ยิ่งเจอการซอยเป็นเรื่องสั้น อ่านไปทีละตอนๆ เหมือนโดนพรางตาว่าอ่านไปแค่ไม่กี่หน้าไม่กี่ตอน ปรากฏว่าหมดเล่มเฉยเลย

อ่านรอบที่สอง ภายใต้ปกใหม่ที่ชื่อว่า ""โกหก ""น่า"" ตาย"" (ปกเก่าคือ ""อย่าหลุดว่าฆ่า"")
รอบนี้รู้สึก เปรี้ยง เปรี้ยง เปรี้ยง เลย
คือโดนความยอดเยี่ยมที่แสนกระชับฝีมือมห่เทพเคโงะเล่นงาน
แถมยังเป็นซีรีย์นายตำรวจสุดเทพ ที่มาในยุคที่ผู้พิทักษ์สันติราษฎร์ของบางประเทศ มีข่าวเลวร้ายไม่เว้นแต่ละวัน มันชวนฝันถึงวันที่จะมีนายตำรวจอย่างคางะ เดินอยู่ตามท้องถนนคงจะอุ่นใจไม่น้อย

เล่มนี้เป็นรวมเรื่องสั้น ที่เล่าอย่างกระชับ ปูพื้นด้วยเหตุ คั่นกลางด้วยลีลาการสอบสวน โหมกระหน่ำให้งวดด้วยดราม่าความสัมพันธ์ แล้วปิดคดีแบบสุดคูล
เรียกได้ว่าอ่านปุ๊บก็จะรู้ปั๊บว่าฆาตกรน่ะเป็นใครตั้งแต่ต้น
แต่ที่สนุกคือประสบการณ์ที่ได้รับระหว่างที่ลุ้นการสืบสวนสอบสวนของคางะ ผสมกับมูลเหตุจูงใจในการก่อคดี และการเฉลยวิธีการมากกว่า

review_2161405544,ไม้ไต่คู้,"Oct 23, 2017","รวมเรื่องสั้นแนวสืบสวน 5 เรื่องของ ฮิงาชิโนะ เคโงะ

เรื่องสั้นทั้ง 5 เรื่องไม่มีความเกี่ยวข้องกัน ไม่จำเป็นต้องอ่านเรียง (แต่ทั้ง 5 เรื่อง มีตัวเอกเป็นเจ้าหน้าที่คางะทั้งหมด)

จุดหนึ่งที่ชอบคือการตั้งชื่อเรื่อง อ่านจบแล้วเข้าใจเลยว่าทำไมถึงชื่อ 'อย่าหลุดว่าฆ่า' เพราะคนโกหกมักจะพยายามพูดความจริงเล็กๆ เพื่อปิดบังความลับอันใหญ่หลวงของตัวเองเอาไว้เสมอ แต่การทำแบบนี้ก็ไม่ใช่เรื่องง่าย เพราะคำโกหกคำแรก อาจนำไปสู่คำโกหกที่สอง สาม สี่ ต่อไปเรื่อยๆ และถูกจับไต๋ได้ในที่สุด

ด้วยความที่เป็นเรื่องสั้น การสืบสวนเพื่อหาตัวคนร้ายจะไม่ได้เน้นไปที่กระบวนการเสาะหาหลักฐานสักเท่าไหร่ แต่จะไปเน้นที่การรุกไล่ด้วยคำพูด ใช้คำถามเป็นอาวุธและหาช่องโหว่ทางตรรกะในคำโกหกของฆาตกร ขยี้ลงไปในคำโกหกที่ถูกเปิดช่องเอาไว้ จนสุดท้ายฆาตกรต้องสารภาพออกมา (พร้อมหลักฐานที่ตัวเอกเคลมว่า 'ไปหามาแล้ว' แต่หนังสือข้ามๆ ไป เพราะกระบวนการหาหลักฐานไม่ใช่ประเด็นหลักของเรื่อง)



โดยส่วนตัวคิดว่าน่าจะเอาตอนที่ 3 มาไว้เป็นเรื่องแรกมากกว่า เพราะเป็นตอนที่เล่นกับแนวทางของหนังสือได้ดีที่สุด แล้วเบรคด้วยตอน 1 - 2 (ซึ่งโดยส่วนตัวคิดว่าไม่ได้แย่ แต่ไม่มีอะไรประทับใจ) ต่อด้วยตอน 4 ที่เป็นเรื่องที่มีจุดพลิกผัน และปิดด้วยตอน 5 ที่เป็นเรื่องที่กินใจที่สุด


โดยสรุป ถือว่าเป็นอีกเล่มที่อ่านสนุกนะครับ ตัวละครก็จะแบนๆ นิดนึงตามประสาเรื่องสั้น และแนวทางการสืบสวนโดยใช้คำพูดเป็นอาวุธก็ถือว่าโอเคเลย

ก็บอกตามตรงว่าค่อนข้างเฉยๆ อาจเป็นเพราะในหลายๆตอน(หรืออาจจะทุกตอน)คนเขียนได้ทำให้เรารู้แล้วว่าใครคือฆาตกร
ซึ่งแปลว่าจุดเด่นของเล่มนี้จะอยู่ที่วิธีการทำให้ฆาตกรจนมุม แต่วิธีการในหลายๆตอนมันกลับดูเหมือนกันเกินไป
เลยทำให้เราค่อนข้างเฉยๆกับเล่มนี้


1. อย่าหลุดว่าฆ่า
ตอนนี้ก็ค่อนข้างเฉยๆ รู้สึกว่าไม่ได้โดดเด่นถึงขนาดว่าเอามาตั้งเป็นชื่อเรื่อง (ชื่อญี่ปุ่นแปลว่าอะไร?)


2. ความร้อนอันเยือกเย็น
ตอนนี้ก็สนุกดี แต่จบแล้วก็จบเลย แถมวิธีการเล่าเรื่องผ่านตัวละครตัวนึงดูจงใจเกินไปถึงจะเป็นจุดประสงค์ของคนเขียนก็เถอะ

3. ความใฝ่ฝันอย่างที่สอง

ทุกเรื่องจะมาแนวๆเดียวกัน คือคนร้ายหรือไม่ก็เป็นใครบางคนพยายามปกปิดความจริง ไปจนถึงสร้างเรื่องราวหลอกลวงขึ้นมา แล้วคุณตำรวจคางะต้องหาทางหลอกล่อให้พวกเขาเผยความจริงออกมา

ทุกเรื่องนั้นคนอ่านจะได้รู้ตั้งแต่แรกว่าใครคือผู้ต้องสงสัย มันดูเหมือนจะไม่ลุ้น แต่จริงๆ แล้วก็มีความน่าติดตาม ได้สนุกตรงเราเองก็พยายามจับผิดคนร้ายไปด้วย ดูว่าจะมีจุดไหนที่เขาพลาดแล้วเราจับได้ไหม สุดท้าย ถ้าเราเป็นตำรวจก็ต้องโดนหลอกหมดแน่ๆ 55555

เรื่องนี้ผู้อ่านสามารถคาดเดาว่าใครคือคนฆ่าเพียงแค่ฉากสองฉากของแต่ละตอน (ผู้แต่งก็จงใจ)
แต่สาระสำคัญอยู่ที่ลักษณะการสืบสวนของนักสืบ คางะ
ที่มีบุคคลิกช่างสังเกต
และที่เก่งคือการไต่สวนจากคำบอกเล่าปากคำต่างๆจนค้นหาคำโกหกที่บิดเบือนจากความเป็นจริงเจอในที่สุด
เราจึงได้อ่านเรื่องราวการปะติดปะต่อวิธีที่ฆาตกรลงมือและเหตุจูงใจในการฆ่าจากคำโกหกที่ซ่อนตัวในบทสนทนามากกว่า
ดังนั้นจะเห็นว่า คางะ อาจมีบุคคลิกน่ารำคาญและไม่น่าคบเท่าไหร่ อันเป็นเหตุเพราะว่าแกชอบจับผิดตลอดเวลานั่นเอง

โหววว.. ไม่คิดว่าจะสนุกขนาดนี้ค่ะ เป็นหนังสือที่วางไม่ลงจริงๆ ขนาดตัวละครค่อนข้างเยอะ ชื่อและคาเรคเตอร์ตัวละครก็ดูไม่โดดเด่นไม่น่าจดจำแท้ๆ แต่เราก็อ่านเล่มนี้จนจบแบบไม่สับสนใดๆ เลยค่ะ 5555

นิยายเล่มนี้มีความประหลาดในการดึงดูดคนอ่านอย่างน่าเหลือเชื่อ เรารู้สึกว่าพล็อตเรื่องค่อนข้างธรรมดา ลูกเล่นในการก่อเหตุดูไม่มีอะไรยุ่งยากซับซ้อนด้วยซ้ำ ตัวละครเอกกับคนร้ายในเรื่องก็แทบจะไม่ได้โชว์ไหวพริบใดๆ มากมาย ทุกอย่างออกจะตรงไปตรงมาและโจ่งแจ้งแจ่มชัด แถมบางครั้งก็รู้สึกเหมือนผู้เขียนแอบเฉลยอะไรบางอย่างตามรายทางตลอดเวลาด้วย

การเล่าเรื่องจะเป็นมุมมองของคิริว เอริโกะ ทั้งเรื่องค่ะ แต่จะเล่าเหตุการณ์ปัจจุบันสลับอดีต ต้นตอของภารกิจลับที่เธอได้รับมอบหมายจากผู้เป็นนาย จนนำไปสู่เหตุเพลิงไหม้ที่พรากคนรักของเธอ และการหวนคืนสู่เรือนระเบียงวนเพื่อชำระแค้นคนร้ายที่บังอาจพรากคนรักไป ผู้เขียนไล่ต้อนคนอ่านอย่างเราที่ตอนต้นเรื่องยังรู้สึกเฉยๆ ให้ไต่ระดับความอิน โดยทำให้คนอ่านสนุกไปกับการได้รู้จักเรื่องราวชีวิตของคิริว และคอยลุ้นว่าเธอจะหาตัวคนร้ายที่ก่อเหตุจัดฉากฆ่าได้รึเปล่า หรือเธอจะโป๊ะแตกโดนตำรวจจับได้เสียก่อนว่าเธอปลอมตัวมา และตอนจบ ก็ได้จบสมใจคิริวเลยค่ะ แต่เป็นการจบที่สมใจและขมขื่นใจพอได้เหมือนกัน

สรุปคือ เรื่องนี้สนุกมากค่ะ! ลูกเล่นชั้นเชิงการก่อเหตุฆาตกรรมไม่มีหรอก อย่าคาดหวังในส่วนนี้เลย แต่ความโดดเด่นของเรื่องอยู่ที่ความดราม่าในใจของคิริวค่ะ เน้นความเจ็บแค้นเคืองโกรธ เน้นไฟแค้นสุมทรวง ระดับความแค้นฝังหุ่นของคิริวนี่ยกให้เป็นที่หนึ่ง 55555",4,10 likes,50

review_3459199096,Tuyet Lan,"Jul 25, 2020","Sau khi đọc ""Bạch dạ hành"", ""Phương trình hạ chí"", ""Ma nữ của Laplace"", ""Điều kì diệu của tiệm tạp hóa Namiya"", mình đã nghĩ đặc trưng truyện của Keigo là lối xây dựng tình tiết chậm rãi trải dài hàng chục năm với một loạt các mối quan hệ chằng chéo. Nhưng mấy tác phẩm đọc gần đây như ""Nghi can X"", ""Sự cứu rỗi của thánh nữ"" và giờ là ""Vụ án mạng ở lữ quán Kairote"" thì thấy ông cũng có không ít tác phẩm phá án nhanh :))

Truyện này có ba điểm sự hấp dẫn khác biệt so với những cuốn mình đã đọc trước đó:
1) Sử dụng ngôi kể thứ nhất thay vì thứ ba. Người kể chính là người gây án, lại là lời nội tâm của một cô gái - cách kể này mới lạ và có chiều sâu hơn hẳn.
2) Vụ án không được phá bởi cảnh sát hay thám tử Galileo, mà bởi nữ chính. Và cái kết kịch tính cũng được tạo ra bởi nữ chính, không ai ngăn chặn được.
3) Sự đánh tráo nạn nhân- hung thủ và sự giả danh, đến 2 lần: lần 1- đã được thông báo từ đầu truyện là của nữ chính, lần 2- bất ngờ hơn là của nam chính.

Có lẽ độc giả thích truyện của Keigo vì trong khi đọc có thể cùng ông ""phá án"": Các manh mối được tác giả rải suốt tác phẩm, nên ta có thể vừa đọc vừa hình thành giả thiết suy luận, rồi hài lòng khi vụ án đúng như mình đã suy đoán. Đồng thời ở kết thúc sẽ có thêm plot twist để người đọc đủ ấn tượng. Truyện này cũng vậy, nhờ vài manh mối tác giả hé lộ, mình đã đoán được việc nam chính (cứ gọi thế đi) giả chết và đánh tráo thân phận. Hay là đọc Connan nhiều quá nên trong lúc đọc mình luôn nghĩ ""không thể đơn giản như vậy, chắc phải có nguyên nhân khác"" chăng :D

Mình luôn nghĩ tác phẩm của Keigo không nên xếp vào mục truyện trinh thám, mà phải ở hạng mục tâm lý xã hội hoặc tâm lý tội phạm thì hợp hơn. Vì mình thấy các vụ án và việc điều tra chỉ là nền cho các vấn đề về tâm lý và hành vi đạo đức của nhân vật. Điều đọng lại sau khi đọc tác phẩm không phải là sự hứng thú với quá trình tìm kiếm manh mối hay ngưỡng mộ sự suy luận phá án tài tình. Mà là sự đau lòng với nguyên nhân của án mạng, sự trăn trở hoặc tranh luận về các vấn đề xã hội- đạo đức mà truyện đặt ra: Vì tình yêu con người có thể làm những gì? Vì giữ thể diện, con người có thể tàn ác ra sao? Những đứa trẻ tha hóa là do môi trường sống tệ hại hay ác ý đã tồn tại sẵn trong lòng chúng? Ở truyện ""Vụ án mạng ở lữ quán Kairote"" thì là sự thương xót cho sự lụi tắt hi vọng hạnh phúc của nữ chính, và đưa ra kết cục thảm thiết cho những kẻ sẵn sàng thực hiện hành vi vô đạo đức để thỏa mãn lòng tham. Lí luận hành vi giết người của nữ chính giống với ông bố đạo diễn trong ""Ma nữ của Laplace: giết người thực để giữ vẹn nguyên hình ảnh của họ trong tâm trí. Nếu người đọc cảm thấy ông đạo diễn đúng là thần kinh, thì ở truyện này lại có thể thông cảm được.",4,6 likes,50

หนังสือสืบสวนสอบสวนสัญชาติญี่ปุ่นเล่มไม่หนา ฝีมือเคโงะเล่มนี้ เน้นเรื่องทริคการก่อคดีฆาตกรรมล้วนๆ

เปิดเรื่องด้วยการตายของชายหนุ่มในเพลิงไหม้เรียวกัง “เรือนระเบียงวน”
ส่วนแฟนสาวที่รอดชีวิตมาได้ก็เสียโฉมไปถาวร แต่ในเพลิงไหม้ครั้งนั้น มันไม่ใช่เป็นการฆ่าตัวตายตามที่ตำรวจหรือใครๆ สรุปกัน แต่เบื้องหลังกลับเป็นกองมรดกมหาศาลของนักธุรกิจไร้ทายาทที่กำลังจะตายด้วยโรคมะเร็ง

หญิงสาวผู้รอดชีวิตทำทุกอย่างเพื่อเสาะหาฆาตกรตัวจริงที่ใช้ไฟพรากชายหนุ่มคนรักไปจากเธอ รวมไปถึงลบชื่อตัวเองออกไปและปลอมตัวเป็นคนอื่นเข้ามาแทน เพื่อตามล่าเหล่าทายาทกองมรดกที่มารวมตัวกันอีกครั้งในวันเปิดพินัยกรรม

เรื่องดูเพลนๆ ไม่ซับซ้อน ส่วนที่ใส่เข้ามาเป็นปมดราม่าจนถึงเป็นมูลเหตุจูงใจ คือการปรากฎตัวของ “ลูกชาย” ทายาทตัวจริงที่ถูกทิ้งไว้ที่โรงเลี้ยงเด็กกำพร้า ซึ่งนั่นแปลว่า ทายาทที่เหลือจะไม่ได้อะไรเลย

อ่านได้เพลิดเพลิน และจบอย่างรวดเรียว ไม่ต้องขบคิดให้ปวดหัว เพราะเคโงะผูกเรื่องทุกอย่างเอาไว้อย่างเหมาะเจาะ และยังคงเอกลักษณ์การเฉลยที่สุดหักมุม

สิ่งที่เสียดายคือการใช้เรียวกัง “เรือนระเบียงวน” ที่เป็นสถานที่เกิดเหตุที่มีโครงสร้างเป็นเอกลักษณ์น้อยไปหน่อย ทั้งๆ ที่ถึงขนาดมีแผนที่เป็นรูปแปลนของ “เรือนระเบียงวน” ไว้ตั้งแต่หน้าแรก แต่ส่วนที่นำมาสร้างทริคหรือสืบสวนสอบสวนกลับน้อยนิด กลับไปเน้นการดำเนินเรื่องผ่าน “คน” มากกว่า",3,4 likes,50

หญิงชราชื่อคุณฮมมะนั่งแท็กซีมาที่เรียวคังเรือนระเบียงวน โรงแรมที่รู้จักกันทั้งจังหวัดว่าเคยเกิดคดีไฟไหม้มีคนตาย ตอนนี้ห้องพักปรับปรุงกลับมาสวยงามสมบูรณ์ดังเดิมแล้ว แต่ก็ยังไม่เปิดให้บริการกับบุคคลภายนอก ผู้เข้าพักก็มีเพียงเครือญาติเจ้าของเท่านั้น

ไม่ต้องรอให้เราสงสัยนาน...
คุณเคโงะจบบทที่หนึ่งโดยการให้หญิงชราเข้าห้องพัก และเมื่อเธอล้างหน้าเสร็จ ใบหน้าในกระจกที่สะท้อนกลับมา คือใบหน้าของผู้หญิงวัย 30 ปี!

โอเค. เรื่องนี้ทั้งเล่มเล่าจากมุมมองตัวละครหญิงค่ะ และเราชื่นชอบงานเขียนของคุณเคโงะที่เล่าด้วยสายตาของผู้หญิงเป็นทุนเดิมอยู่แล้ว (เช่น พิษรักสั่งตาย) เล่มนี้นี่เราชอบได้โดยง่ายเลยค่ะ

ผู้หญิงคนหนึ่ง ปลอมตัวเป็นหญิงชรา มาเข้าพักในโรงแรมที่เคยเกิดไฟไหม้ หนึ่งวันก่อนเปิดพินัยกรรมของท่านประธาน(เจ้าของโรงแรม)... แล้วจะทำไม? เรื่องจะเป็นไงต่อ?

ผู้หญิงคนนี้เป็นใคร?
แล้วทำไมต้องมาในสภาพหญิงชราด้วย?
แต่เดี๋ยวนะ คนในตระกูลนี้รู้จักหญิงชราคนนี้อยู่แล้วด้วย!?

สนุกมากๆ ค่ะ
ไม่ได้อ่านงานคุณเคโงะที่ทำเราอ่านรวดจบเล่มแบบนี้ได้นานแล้วนะ

เราตอบเล่มระเบียงวนฯ นี่ไปเลยค่ะ
สนุก ฉึบฉับ เดินเรื่องไว
ให้ความรู้สึกเหมือนดูหนังฝรั่งแนว suspense thriller (ถึงฉากจะเป็นโรงแรมญี่ปุ่น แต่วิธีเล่าเล่มนี้ฝรั่งมากค่ะ)

เล่มนี้ plot-based เน้นๆ ดังนั้น ความลึกของตัวละครจะเอาไปเทียบพวกงานชิ้นเอกไม่ได้นะคะ

review_3601266960,Gain Lã,"Oct 24, 2020","Vụ Án Mạng Ở Lữ Quán Kairotei là một tác phẩm dễ đọc tuy nhiên không hay nhưng cũng chẳng dở.

Hơn nửa đầu cuốn sách chẳng có gì đặc sắc, mạch truyện tịnh tiến đều với không xoắn não gì nên mình đọc khá nhanh thành ra cũng khá nhàm.

Sau đó tác giả lại dẫn dắt vô cùng tài tình. Nhiều lúc mình phải đọc chậm lại hoặc tạm dừng để thử lập luận và nghĩ xem ra sao.

Nhưng nói thật chắc mình vẫn còn non so với loại truyện này hay nói cụ thể hơn là so với văn của bác Keigo nên đoán già đón non cuối cùng trật lất hết... Thế mà lại hay, chứ dễ quá thì tụt cả hứng, nhỉ. Dù vậy, plot twist cao trào nhất cũng chỉ nằm ở vài trang cuối nên kiểu như trông ngóng quá trời mà lại chỉ ""phê"" được xí, chả đã gì hết...

Thôi thì dù gì đây cũng là cuốn đầu mình chọn cho chuỗi hưởng ứng Halloween cũng như cho dàn truyện của bác Keigo (sau cuốn Phía Sau Nghi Can X mình đọc 2 năm trước) nên mình chọn cuốn nhẹ nhất, dễ trôi nhất và là một kiểu trinh thám kinh điển nên vậy là ổn.

Thiệt đáng mong chờ những cuốn tiếp theo. Liệu mình có phải nhảy lên chuyến tàu lượn siêu tốc mang tên cảm xúc không nhỉ...",3,3 likes,50

Một tác phẩm lưng chừng giữa hay và cũng bình thường.

Mình đã hi vọng phút cuối có đột phá gì đó ở nhân vật ông chú Nobyuki vì từ đầu bác Keigo xây dựng nhân vật này khá bí ẩn, hay ho và có đôi chút mờ ám...ai ngờ cuối cùng thì ""anh cũng chỉ là người bình thường thôi"".

Cú lật mặt ở cuối truyện thật ra cũng không quá bất ngờ, nhưng cũng đủ để gây sửng sốt và thỏa mãn sau khi phải kinh qua 7749 các biến cố có phần hơi dài dòng :)))
...cái làm mình bất ngờ hơn cả là khả năng make up thần sầu của nhân vật nữ chính :v thật không thể tin được!!!

Nói chung là có thể cân nhắc 4* vì cuốn này là một sự khác lạ nhẹ sau một lô lốc những tác phẩm trước có phần hơi quá nặng nề và dài hơi về tâm lí và các vấn đề xã hội.",4,2 likes,50

review_3497958643,QHuong(BookSpy),"Aug 16, 2020","Không làm mình thất vọng. Có thể đọc một mạch trong một ngày luôn. Khác với Án mạng 11 chữ, người đọc theo chân nhân vật chính, Eriko, thực hiện công cuộc trả thù cho một tội ác ngày trước đã hãm hại người yêu của cô. Nhưng không chỉ đơn giản như vậy, Eriko cải trang thành một người khác để thâm nhập vào nhóm nghi phạm, tất cả họ tập hợp tại lữ quán cho một buổi đọc di chúc. Vì vậy mà, không chỉ đơn giản là ta theo dõi hành trình truy ra căn nguyên sự việc cùng Eriko, mà còn lo lắng, thấp thỏm lo sợ rằng danh tính thật của Eriko sẽ bị phát hiện.

Không khí truyện ban đầu đọc không khác gì một trong những vụ án trong truyện Conan, sau đó lại có hơi hướng của phim Knives Out nữa. Trong quá trình đọc lại có thể tha hồ đoán mò hung thủ, và nếu tiện hơn thì có thể vẽ lại sơ đồ của lữ quán để tự mình suy luận. Mình không hơi đâu làm thế, cứ tự đoán mò theo trực giác thôi, ai ngờ mình đoán đúng 100%!
Ban đầu tác giả ném một đống tên nhân vật trong nhóm nghi phạm làm mình hoang mang quá độ vì không kịp nhớ tên, nhưng dần dần cũng phân biệt rõ ràng ai với ai.

Truyện được kể theo hình thức song song giữa hiện tại và tái hiện quá khứ qua lời kể của nhân vật chính. Qua đó thì người đọc cũng hình dung được động cơ trả thù của cô và tại sao cô nghi ngờ những nhân vật còn lại có tham gia vào tội ác quá khứ.

Mình thích cuốn này một phần vì cách tác giả xây dựng được một nhân vật nữ khá là lạnh lùng, tỉ mỉ như thế này. Cô tính toán một kế hoạch tương đối là chu đáo, sắp xếp trước khi nào cần dụ hung thủ và chuẩn bị những phương cách đối phó trước. Thế mà vẫn có những bước ngoặt ngoài dự tính khi một trong các nghi phạm đó bị giết. Eriko buộc phải xem lại những suy luận của mình, trong khi vẫn đảm bảo danh tính mình không bị lộ ra. Khá phục cả những lúc cô ứng biến rất nhanh trong những trường hợp cần sự suy nghĩ nhanh nhạy.

Tuy nhiên một điều lạ xảy ra trái ngược hẳn với sự cẩn thận và tỉ mỉ của Eriko mà mình thấy thật phi lý. Khi cải trang thành một người, ta phải học và bắt chước mọi thứ về người đó (họ giỏi gì, biết gì, thích gì, dáng đi thế nào...). Với bản tính của Eriko thì rõ ràng là cô sẽ phải làm thế. Nhưng cô đã sơ suất phạm một lỗi cơ bản về cải trang, cô biết rằng người mà cô đang cải trang rất giỏi về vấn đề đó, nhưng cô đã chủ quan không thèm đọc hay học hỏi về nó, dẫn đến khả năng bị lộ là rất cao. Mình thấy rằng có rất nhiều cách khác nhau để làm lộ Eriko, chứ còn dùng chi tiết này để lộ cô ấy thì không nhất quán với bản chất tỉ mỉ cẩn thận của cô.

Anh thanh tra ban đầu đọc thấy có vẻ hứa hẹn nhưng rốt cuộc cũng không làm được gì mấy. Theo mình thấy thì anh ta quá nóng vội và cố chấp, những tính cách không nên có ở một điều tra viên phải giữ cái đầu tỉnh táo. Anh ta ương bướng và không chịu mở rộng ra những hướng điều tra khác nhau vì chỉ khăng khăng vào một lối suy nghĩ nhất định. Hơn nữa, cảm giác như nghiệp vụ điều tra của anh ta cũng không được tốt lắm (về vấn đề hung thủ bóp cổ nạn nhân sau khi nạn nhân bị đâm chết), đến gần cuối khi việc phá án cũng mò được tầm 70% rồi mà anh ta vẫn giữ nguyên quan điểm của mình về việc đó.

Cuốn này đọc cảm thấy nóng hôi hổi, vì cảm xúc của Eriko rất mãnh liệt (trái ngược hẳn với giọng văn bàng quan, hờ hững của nhân vật “tôi” trong Án mạng 11 chữ). Công cuộc trả thù vô cùng quyết liệt, đầy cảm xúc, vì tính chất của nó là tư thù, cảm giác bẽ bàng vì bị lợi dụng, bị lừa dối. Khi biết được hung thủ, mình không ngờ cách phản ứng của Eriko lại đẩy đến mức cao như vậy. Nhưng nó vẫn chưa phải là cao trào, đó chỉ là phần tiệm cận thôi. Đến phần cao trào thì cảm xúc thật sự lúc đấy mới bùng phát, tạo một cái kết khá là thoả đáng.",5,7 likes,50

Cá nhân mình thấy những quyển đời đầu bác Keigo viết thì chủ yếu đậm màu trinh thám mà không có màu tâm lý đan xen rõ nét như mấy cuốn sau này. Bài học giá trị nhân văn rút ra cũng không nhiều như những tác phẩm về sau. Đây chỉ là 1 cuốn trinh thám giải trí đơn thuần đọc để thư giãn.

review_4085452062,Trung Đỉnh,"Jul 01, 2021","Vụ án mạng ở lữ quán Kairotei | Higashino Keigo (Dã Tràng dịch)

• Mình sẽ xếp Vụ án mạng ở lữ quán Kairotei vào thể loại trinh thám kinh điển ha, hoặc bất cứ thể loại trinh thám nào mà có nội dung chủ đạo là điều tra, phá án. Nhưng mà hơi khác một chút với việc điều tra hay phá án vốn là nhiệm vụ của cơ quan chức năng, hoặc thám từ chẳng hạn. Ở quyển này quá trình “phá án” là quá trình một nạn nhân tìm hung thủ thật sự đằng sau tội ác với mục đích là báo thù.

• Câu chuyện được kể theo ngôi thứ nhất, nhân vật “tôi” là nạn nhân của vụ hỏa hoạn xảy ra tại lữ quán Kairotei nửa năm trước. Hôm nay cô ta trở lại với hình hài và thân phận khác nhằm báo thù kẻ thủ ác trong vụ án nửa năm trước. Vì được kể theo ngôi thứ nhất nên mình đã có nghi ngờ về cú twist có lẽ sẽ là “người kể chuyện không đáng tin cậy”. Nhưng nghi ngờ là vậy thôi, mình vẫn không nhận ra những thông tin bị ẩn đi. Không biết có phải gọi cú twist là “người kể chuyển không đáng tin cậy” hay không nữa vì cô ta trần thuật lại câu chuyện tất cả các chi tiết đều là thật, chỉ có mình hiểu sai thôi.

• Cũng phải nói thêm về câu chuyện của gia đình trong cuốn tiểu thuyết. Về thừa kế thì mình không thắc mắc gì, nhưng đến phần tình cảm của các thanh niên trong gia đình thật là lạ. Em họ có tình cảm với chị họ con của bác mà mọi người trong gia đình đều thấy là bình thường, mình có tham khảo luật hôn nhân gia đình ở Việt Nam thì việc kết hôn của hai người này nếu có ý định đó thì sẽ bị cấm, cũng vẫn bị cấm với luật gia đình ở Nhật Bản. Hay là vào năm quyển sách này được xuất bản thì việc kết hôn với anh chị em họ là không bị cấm (1991).

• Và đó là tất cả những gì mình muốn nói đến trong quyển này. Với mình thì cũng khá cuốn hút, thú vị với twist cuối truyện mặc dù là phần đầu truyển làm mình hơi bối rối nên chững lại. Từ giữa truyện thì đọc rất mượt. Tính cách của nhân vật “tôi” cũng khá thú vị nữa. Sau khi đọc xong thì “Vụ án mạng ở lữ quán Kairotei” đã khiến mình phải tìm ngay Luật hôn nhân gia đình. Coi như biết thêm về vấn đề kết hôn với người có họ hàng.",4,1 like,50

Cái hay của truyện nằm ở cách kể câu chuyện theo ngôi thứ nhất (hung thủ), và cách thức gây án của hung thủ 1 và 2 là động cơ và mục đích của nhau.

Ngắn gọn súc tích là điểm cộng dù tác phẩm được viết hơn 30 năm rồi. Nhân một ngày mà phim chuyển thể bản Trung có trailer nên mình lấy ra đọc lần 2. Hy vọng phim hay.",4,1 like,50

วรรณกรรมสืบสวนสอบสวนในซีรีย์ ‘พิกัดต่อไปใครเป็นศพ? (Masquerade eve)’ ฝีมือ Higashino Keigo เล่มนี้ เหมือนกับเป็นเล่ม ‘Begin’ ของซีรีย์ เพราะเริ่มเล่าที่มาที่ไปของสองตัวละครหลักอย่าง ‘นาโอมิ’ สาวพนักงานโรงแรมสุดเป๊ะ และ ‘นิตตะ’ ตำรวจหนุ่มสุดขรึม
ทั้งคู่ต่างเป็นคนรุ่นใหม่ไฟแรงในสายงานของตน
และทั้งคู่ ยังมีความสามารถด้านการสังเกตและวิเคราะห์แบบเป็นเหตุเป็นผลที่ล้ำไปกว่าคนอื่น

หนังสือเล่มนี้แยกย่อยเป็น 4 ตอนที่ไม่ได้ยึดโยงเนื้อหาต่อกัน แต่ละเรื่อง ตัวละครทั้งคู่ยังไม่ได้มีโอกาสเจอกัน
เรียกว่าเป็น spin-off มาเล่าภารกิจและความเก่งกาจของแต่ละคนมากกว่า

อ่านง่าย อ่านเพลิน เปิดพรึ่บๆ
เป็นฆาตกรรมที่ไม่อี๋แหวะ

ต้องบอกเลยว่า Keigo ยังคงสร้างทั้งความน่าทึ่ง และความประทับใจ ให้กับผู้อ่านได้เสมอ
แม้ซีรีย์ 'พิกัดต่อไปใครเป็นศพ’ จะไม่ลงดราม่าหนักหน่วง
แต่งานของ Keigo ยังคงเด่นเรื่อง ‘คน’ และ ‘ความสัมพันธ์’ อย่างเสมอต้นเสมอปลาย ไม่ปล่อยให้เป็น suspense แบบแห้งๆ มิติเดียว

หนังสือเล่มนี้ผู้อ่านสามารถอ่านได้โดยไม่จำเป็นต้องอ่านเล่มแรก 'พิกัดต่อไปใครเป็นศพ’ มาก่อน

ถ้าจำไม่ผิดผมจะโดนป้ายยาตั้งแต่ก่อนโควิด นอนเหงาอยู่บนชั้นหนังสือ ผมที่เริ่มเป็นติ่งเคโงะ ตั้งแต่เริ่มอ่านผลงานอย่าง กลลวงซ่อนตาย หรือ ปาฏิหารย์ร้ายชำคุณนามิยะ ฤกษ์งามยามดี หยิบผลงานเล่มนี้เชยชม

ทีแรกผมคิดว่าจะเป็นรหัสคดียาวเหมือนเล่มอื่นๆ (จริงๆเขาเขียนหลังปกละไม่นอมอ่าน 555) แต่เล่มนี้จะมาในลักษณะเรื่องสั้น ดำเนินตัดสลับผ่านตัวละครหลักสองตัวอย่าง นาโอมิ เสมียนโรงแรมช่างสังเกต กับสัญชาตญาณการอนุมานที่ไม่ธรรมดา กับ โคสุเกะ ตำรวจหนุ่ม ดีกรีนอก ความสามารถสูง ที่เข้าไปพัวพันรหัสคดีน้อยใหญ่ สลัดหน้ากากคนร้าย ชวนเพื่อนๆทุกท่านมาติดตาม

แม้จะเป็นเรื่องสั้นหลากรสผิดคาด แต่ความสนุกสนานไม่ได้ดร๊อปลงแม้แต่น้อย “หน้ากาก” ตัวชูโรงหรือแก่นเรื่อง ผู้เขียนสะท้อนความคิดของคนออกมาได้หลากมิติ ไล่เรียงความซับซ้อนของคดีเป็นลำดับ เข้าถึงง่ายเป็นมิตรกับนักอ่าน ติดหนึบอย่างรวดเร็ว ยิ่งเรื่องยาวสุดท้าย ผูกปม ขมวดออกมาได้ ชวนติดตาม บันเทิง เป็นอย่างยิ่ง

สุดท้าย “การกระชากหน้ากาก” เห็นธาตุแท้ของผู้คนนั้นชวนเรานึกถึงสังคมลายล้อม ทุกคนล้วนสวมหน้ากาก หนา บาง เล็ก ใหญ่ ราบเรียบ ซับซ้อน จุดประสงค์ดีร้ายแตกต่าง ขัดเกลาความเข้าใจชีวิต

4 เรื่องสั้นในเล่ม จะแบ่งเป็น 2 คดี ที่ออกจะเป็นแนว cozy mystery ของนาโอมิ เธอทำหน้าที่เป็นพนักงานต้อนรับของโรงแรมที่คอยสังเกตุพฤติกรรมแปลก ๆ ของลูกค้า และคอยแก้ไขปัญหาอย่างชาญฉลาด โดยเรื่องแรกเป็นเรื่องของลูกค้าหญิงที่เข้าพักแต่กลับหายตัวไป กับอีกเรื่องหนึ่งเป็นเรื่องของนักเขียนที่ต้องปิดบังตัวตน เธอต้องคอยปกป้องหน้ากากของลูกค้า เพราะเรื่องบางเรื่องก็ไม่ควรให้ใครรู้🏢

อีก 2 เรื่องของตำรวจหนุ่มนิตตะนั้น เรื่องแรกจะเป็นคดีฆาตกรรมชายที่วิ่งออกกำลังกายกลางดึก และอีกเรื่องจะเป็นคดีฆาตกรรมอาจารย์ในมหาวิทยาลัย เรื่องหลังนี่ค่อนข้างยาว ที่จริงนำไปพิมพ์แยกเล่มก็ยังได้ และเรื่องนี้เองทำให้นิตตะต้องหาหลักฐานในโรงแรมที่นาโอมิทำงานอยู่ ซึ่งเป็นจุดเริ่มต้นที่นาโอมิช่วยนิตตะกระชากหน้ากากคนร้ายนั่นเอง🎭

review_1805000026,Kaz,"Nov 06, 2016",表題作他三作収録。作品は特に好みでは無かったけれど、それなりに面白く書けているとは思った。私が入り込みにくいのは、まず彼の作品の女性登場人物達が単純過ぎたり冷たかったりで、好きになれない。そして推理の多くがスムーズに立証され、捜査の葛藤や苛立ちが弱くて、登場人物に心情移入しにくい。頭が良いから推理が全て当たる、というのはあまりにもフィクション過ぎて人間臭さがなく、読んでて退屈になってくるというのが本音。,2,2 likes,53

""พิกัดต่อไปใครเป็นศพ? ตอนลางร้ายใต้หน้ากาก"" เป็นรวมเรื่องสั้น 4 เรื่องภายใต้ธีมสวมหน้ากากของ higashino keigo ในซีรีส์นิตตะ+นาโอมิ
ทุกเรื่องล้วนมีคนสวมหน้ากาก คุณนิตตะมีหน้าที่เปิดโปงหน้ากาก
ส่วนคุณนาโอมิมีหน้าที่ช่วยลูกค้าของโรงแรมรักษาหน้ากากเหล่านั้นไว้

เล่มนี้ประกอบด้วย 3 เรื่องสั้นมาก และ 1 เรื่องสั้นขนาดยาว
เนื้อหาของทุกเรื่องในเล่มนี้เกิดขึ้นก่อนที่คุณตำรวจนิตตะจะได้ไปเจอคุณนาโอมิใน ""พิกัดต่อไปใครเป็นศพ"" (ปกตุ๊กตาญี่ปุ่น) ค่ะ
.
.
เรื่องที่ 1 ""หน้ากากของต่ละคน""
เล่าเรื่องสมัยคุณนาโอมิเพิ่งเริ่มมาทำงานโรงแรม ยังไม่ได้เป็นพนักงานระดับท็อปฟอร์ม ยังต้องให้รุ่นพี่คอยสอน
อยู่มาวันหนึ่ง คนรักเก่าสมัยเรียนของเธอก็มาเช็คอินเข้าพักเพื่อเตรียมทำงาน และเขาขอให้เธอช่วยปกปิดความจริงให้หน่อย เพราะเค้าแต่งงานแล้ว แต่นัดชู้รักของตัวเองมาเปิดห้อง
ในเรื่องนี้ เราจะได้เรียนคุณค่าหลักที่คุณนาโอมิยึดถือ นั่นคือ
""ผู้คนที่มาใช้บริการโรงแรมต่างสวมหน้ากากลูกค้า เราจะไปยุ่มย่ามกับหน้ากากของพวกเขาไม่ได้เด็ดขาด""
.
.
เรื่องที่ 2 ""น้องใหม่มาแล้ว""
ถ้าไม่นับคุณคางะ จากซีรีส์คางะ คุณนิตตะก็เป็นตัวเอกที่เป็นตำรวจเหมือนกันค่ะ
แต่คุณนิตตะจะตรงข้ามกับคุณคางะจอมเงียบเลยค่ะ เพราะเขาช่างพูด ทำอะไรตรงมา โพล่งไปเลยตรงๆ ตามประสาเด็กจบจากอเมริกาแต่เลือกมาทำงานเป็นตำรวจที่ญี่ปุ่น
ความต่างอีกอย่างหนึ่งก็คือ คุณนิตตะเป็นตัวละครที่คุณเคโงะแปะป้ายมาเลยแต่ต้นว่าเขา ""หล่อ สมาร์ท มาดดี"" สุดๆ ค่ะ 555
ฉบับคนแสดง ได้คิมุระ ทาคุยะมารับบทเป็นคุณนิตตะค่ะ :-)

สำหรับเรื่องนี้ เป็นสมัยที่คุณนิตตะเพิ่งเป็นตำรวจได้ไม่นาน ยังได้ทำแต่งานผู้ช่วยให้รุ่นพี่
แต่ด้วยมุมมองและวิธีวิเคราะห์ที่ไม่เหมือนตำรวจคนอื่น (แถมฮียังลงมือทดลองเองจนเป็นเรื่อง) ก็ทำให้เป็นที่หนักใจ พอๆ กับที่พวกผู้ใหญ่เห็นแววในตัวคุณนิตตะ

คดีนี้เป็นคดีที่ชายหนุ่มเจ้าของร้านอาหารหลายแห่งถูกแทงขณะวิ่งออกกำลังบนเส้นทางประจำ
เขาเป็นเจ้านายที่เป็นที่รักของลูกน้อง และขึ้นชื่อเรื่องเป็นคนให้ความสำคัญกับครอบครัวเป็นพิเศษ
ถ้าอย่างนั้นแล้ว... ทำไมถึงมีคนไม่พอใจจนต้องลงมือฆ่าเขาด้วยล่ะ?
.
.
เรื่องที่ 3 ""หน้ากากกับการปกปิดตัวตน""
ตัดกลับมาเล่าที่ฝั่งคุณนาโอมิกันอีกครั้ง เมื่อแขกที่มาเช็คอินเป็นบ.ก.ของสนพ.แห่งหนึ่ง
คุณบ.ก.ตั้งใจมาเปิดห้องสี่คืนให้นักเขียนสาวดาวรุ่งมือรางวัลเข้าพัก เพื่อให้เธอเค้นสมองเคี่ยวต้นฉบับออกมาให้เสร็จทันเดดไลน์ให้จงได้
แต่ทั้งที่การเข้าพักครั้งนี้เป็นความลับแท้ๆ แต่กลับมีกลุ่มชายฉกรรจ์(ลักษณะเหมือนพวกตามติดนักร้องสาวไอดอล) มาซุ่มดักรอ
พวกเขาทั้งทำเรื่องเข้าพักและจัดเวรสอดส่องตามหานักเขียนสาวอย่างเป็นระบบ

คุณนาโอมิและพนักงานโรงแรมต้องดูแลทั้งแขกที่จงใจมาก่อกวน(กลุ่มแฟนคลับ) พร้อมกับดูแลความเป็นส่วนตัวของคุณนักเขียนและคุณบ.ก.
และต้องทำให้ได้โดยไม่เสียมาตรฐานการบริการของโรงแรมห้าดาวด้วย
.
.
เรื่องที่ 4 ""คืนก่อนวันงานเลี้ยงเต้นรำหน้ากาก""
ตอนเปิดเรื่อง เรานึกว่าอ่านซีรีส์กาลิเลโออยู่ เพราะคนตายเป็นอาจารย์สอนอยู่ที่คณะวิทยาศาสตร์และวิศวกรรมศาสตร์
ทั้งยังเป็นหัวเรี่ยวหัวแรงสำคัญในการวิจัยวัสดุชนิดใหม่ที่จะสั่นสะเทือนวงการ อาจารย์คนนี้หายตัวไป และถูกพบเป็นศพอยู่ข้างห้องวิจัยนั่นเอง

เรื่องนี้หนาขนาด 2/5 ของเล่ม อ่านไปก็สงสัยว่าคุณเคโงะจะมาไม้ไหน เพราะก็รู้ทั้งรู้ว่ากำลังอ่านซีรีส์นิตตะ+นาโอมิไม่ได้มีศ.ยุคาว่าอยู่แถวนี้สักหน่อย

ถ้าเทียบกับ 3 เรื่องสั้นมากก่อนหน้าที่มีเสน่ห์ดึงดูดให้อ่านต่อได้เรื่อยๆ เรากลับพบว่าเรื่องสุดท้ายเดินเรื่องจืดชืดสนิท
การแนะนำตัวละครใหม่ คุณตำรวจสาวริสะ ไม่ได้ทำให้เรื่องสนุกขึ้นเลย ออกจะทำให้ดูน่ารำคาญมากขึ้นด้วยซ้ำ สงสารนางว่าทำไมถึงถูกวางคาแรคเตอร์ออกมาให้เป็นเด็กอมมือขนาดนี้
แต่พอเฉลยตอนจบเท่านั้น ก็ถึงกับอึ้ง... ว่าคุณเคโงะคิดพล็อตแบบนี้มาได้ไง!

และที่งงยิ่งกว่าก็คือ ทำไมคุณเคโงะแกไม่เอาเรื่องนี้ไปเขียนเป็นนิยาย แต่กลับเลือกเอาพล็อตนี้มาทำเป็นเรื่องสั้น
ทั้งที่เรื่องนี้ขยี้มากกว่านี้ได้อีกเยอะมาก และถ้าบิดเรื่องเล่าจากมุมมองแบบอื่น เราว่าเรื่องนี้ต้องสนุกสุดๆ ไปเลยแท้ๆ
เราเสียดายพล็อตน่ะค่ะ สรุปว่าชอบพล็อต แต่ไม่ปลื้มกับการลำดับเรื่อง
.
.
เราเองก็พลาดไปนะที่ไม่ได้อ่านเล่มนี้ตั้งแต่ออกใหม่ๆ แต่ดองมา 2-3 ปีเห็นจะได้
ซีรีส์นิตตะ+นาโอมิสนุกและอ่านสบายพอๆ กับซีรีส์คางะค่ะ
เรื่องสั้นในเล่มนี้ ถ้าเทียบแล้วถือว่าอ่านสนุกกว่าเรื่องสั้นในซีรีส์กาลิเลโอด้วยค่ะ

ติดเรื่องหน้าปกนิดหน่อย เพราะมันดูน่ากลัวเกินไปหลายเบอร์มากๆ ค่ะ
โปรดจินตนาการภาพล็อบบี้ในโรงแรมหรู แชนเดอเลีย และห้องพักวิวสวยยามค่ำคืนแทนหน้าปกนี้แล้วกันนะคะ เพราะเนื้อหาในเล่มไม่ได้มีอะไรลึกลับ หลอน หรือน่ากลัวตรงไหนเลยค่ะ

เราเองก็มองข้ามเล่มนี้ดองข้ามปีมาเนิ่นนาน
ไม่อยากให้ทุกคนพลาดอ่านงานเขียนสนุกๆ นะคะ
หวังว่าสนพ.น้ำพุจะหยิบงานคุณเคโงะมาพิมพ์เพิ่มอีกค่ะ :-)",4,,53

ที่ต้องใช้ในเวลาทำงานและอยู่ภายได้กฎเกณท์ของหน้าที่การงาน

昔（中学３年くらい？）読んだマスカレードホテルにどハマりして、次はまだかと楽しみにしていて、ずっと温めていたイブとナイト。期待値が高かったのもあって落差が大きかったかも。
そもそもあまり短編集が好きじゃないっていうのと、一応新田と尚美が出会う前の話ってことだったから納得がいくっちゃいくんだけど、「イブ」までの章がつまらなかったし、もっと二人の扱う事件が絡み合うと思っていたのに結局全然関係なかったし、なんなら新田の田所美千代事件も結局うやむやなまま終わって中途半端。「イブ」ですら、ほとんど尚美は関係なくて、最後の交換殺人がわかってくるあたりは引き込まれたけど、それまではウダウダ新田が行き詰まってるだけだった。
東野圭吾ってこんなんだっけ…と思ってしまうくらいに微妙。確かにテンポはいいし軽い読み物としてはいいのかもしれないけどほぼ会話文でストーリーが成り立ってて何の深みもなかった。尚美はかっこいいけど、その他の女性陣がstereotypicalで、それも飽き飽きしてしまう。ほとんどがファムファタル系の悪い女、その他はお馬鹿で明るい女の子か、頭のおかしい女とか。

읽으면서 생각하는건 여자의 관점이 조금 마음에 들지는 않았다. 남자를 이용한다, 약하다, 눈치없이 궁금증이 크다. 라는 느낌이 좀 커서 싫었다.

하지만 닛타랑 나오미들의 햇병아리 모습을 보니 조금 흐뭇했다. 닛타는 어렸을때 부터 관심이랑, 의심, 추리력이 엄청 뛰어났다는걸 느꼈다. 그러면서 자기가 공을 새우는것보다는 단지 범인을 잡고 싶다는 의지가 강했다.
나오미는 호텔 프런트 직원으로 서툴리면서 손님의 관심과 열정이 보였다. 나오미는 형사를 만나기 전부터 그녀의 능력으로 대단한 추리가 가능하다고 느꼈다. 이 점들을 정말로 마음에 들었다.

review_2169440272,ไม้ไต่คู้,"Oct 31, 2017","ยังไม่ใช่งานมาสเตอร์พีซแบบกลลวงซ่อนตาย แต่นิยายของลุงเคโงะยังทำให้รู้สึกหลงรักได้เหมือนเดิม

สิ่งที่ชอบมาก ๆ ในนิยายเรื่องนี้ คือการเป็นนิยายสืบสวน ที่ไม่ได้มุ่งแต่จะเล่าเรื่องการสืบสวนเพียงอย่างเดียว แต่ยังเล่นประเด็นเรื่องมุมมองอาชีพและความคิดที่แตกต่างของตัวละครหลักทั้งสองตัวด้วย (และก็จริงจังถึงขนาดทำให้สิ่งนี้กลายเป็นแก่นที่ใช้ในการเดินเรื่องไปเลย)

การต้องมาร่วมงานกับคนที่มีมุมมองและวิธีคิดที่แตกต่างจากตนเองอย่างสิ้นเชิง (ภายใต้สถานการณ์ที่ไม่ปกติ) ทำให้ตัวละครมีการพัฒนาอยู่เรื่อย ๆ และมี Conflict ให้ต้องต่อสู้อยู่ตลอดเวลา

การเล่นประเด็นเรื่อง ""วิธีคิดแบบพนักงานโรงแรม"" ทำให้นิยายสามารถดึงเอกลักษ์เฉพาะตัวของอาชีพนี้มาใช้ได้อย่างเต็มที่ ฉากหลังของเรื่อง (โรงแรม) เลยกลายเป็นหนึ่งในองค์ประกอบสำคัญขึ้นมาโดยปริยาย

ในขณะที่พาร์ทการสืบสวนก็ทำได้ดีมาก โดยเฉพาะช่วงองค์สาม ที่เริ่มเข้าสู่ช่วงการคลี่คลายคดี ก็กระตุ้นให้เราอยากพลิกหน้าต่อไปและรู้สึกตื่นเต้นจนจบเรื่อง

และแม้จะเป็นนิยายสืบสวน แต่ผู้เขียนก็ไม่ได้ชี้นำหรือสรุปแทนเราว่า ""วิธีคิดแบบพนักงานโรงแรม"" หรือ ""วิธีคิดแบบตำรวจ"" ที่เป็นฝ่ายถูก ทั้ง ๆ ที่ความเป็นนิยายสืบสวนมักจะเปิดช่องให้เราสามารถ ""อวย"" วิธีคิดแบบตำรวจได้ แต่ผู้เขียนก็เลือกที่จะไม่ทำ ซึ่งโดยส่วนตัวมองว่าการไม่พยายาม ""มอบคำตอบ"" แบบนี้ น่าจะเป็นการตัดสินใจที่ถูกต้องแล้ว

ข้อด้อยสำคัญคือ เมื่ออ่านจบแล้ว รู้สึกว่าเรื่องยังขาดความสะเทือนใจอยู่บ้าง ในตอนสุดท้ายเราจะได้รู้ถึงเหตุจูงใจและแรงผลักดันของฆาตกร แต่โดยส่วนตัวก็รู้สึกว่ามันยังไม่สะเทือนใจเท่าไหร่ แค่อยู่ในระดับ ""เข้าใจได้"" เท่านั้น (ประมาณพวกวายร้าย of the week ในโคนัน)

ซึ่งความรู้สึกสะเทือนใจน่าจะเป็นหัวใจสำคัญของการเล่าเรื่อง เพราะไม่ว่าทริคหรือองค์ประกอบอื่น ๆ จะดีแค่ไหน แต่เมื่อเวลาผ่านไปเราก็อาจจะค่อย ๆ ลืมรายละเอียดเหล่านั้นไป แต่ความรู้สึกสะเทือนใจคือสิ่งที่จะฝังลึกอยู่ในใจเราไปอีกนาน (เหมือนตอนอ่าน 'กลลวงซ่อนตาย' จบ มันจะทิ้งความรู้สึกอื้ออึงบางอย่างไว้ แต่เรื่องนี้จะไม่ถึงขั้นนั้น )

ส่วนข้อด้อยเล็ก ๆ น้อย ๆ คือ ตอนกลางเรื่องเหมือนจะเล่นเรื่อง ""ความเป็นมืออาชีพของพนักงานโรงแรม"" มากไปหน่อย จนเราลืมไปพักนึงเลยว่ากำลังอ่านนิยายสืบสวนและคนพวกนี้กำลังตามหาฆาตกรกันอยู่



โดยสรุป เป็นอีกเล่มที่ชอบมากและไม่ผิดหวัง จริง ๆ อยากให้ 5 ดาว แต่เรื่องยังขาดความสะเทือนใจอยู่บ้าง (ซึ่งโดยส่วนตัวมองว่าสำคัญมาก) เลยต้องหักใจให้แค่ 4 ดาวละกัน",4,6 likes,54

ตัวเลขประหลาดปริศนาที่ทิ้งไว้เป็นเพียงเงื่อนงำอย่างเดียวที่มี
ชุดตัวเลขถูกถอดรหัสออกมาแล้วชี้ว่า “พิกัดต่อไป คดีฆาตกรรมจะเกิดขึ้นที่โรงแรมหรูในโตเกียว”

เนื้อเรื่องดำเนินผ่านตัวละครหลัก 2 คน
คนหนึ่งเป็นสาวสวยพนักงานต้อนรับของโรงแรม
อีกคนหนึ่งเป็นตำรวจหนุ่มหล่อมาดเข้ม

ตำรวจหนุ่มต้องปลอมตัวเข้ามาเป็นพนักงานต้อนรับ เพื่อจับตาดู สืบคดี และเฝ้าระวังเหตุร้าย

เพราะตำรวจหนุ่มต้องสวมบทบาทพนักงานโรงแรมให้เนียนกริ๊บ จึงต้องให้สาวพนักงานต้อนรับสอนงานอย่างเข้มงวด
ต้องเจอลูกค้าหลากหลายรูปแบบ แถมยังมีวิธีการรับมือแบบมืออาชีพที่คูลมากอีกตะหาก
ความเจ๋งคือ ตำรวจหนุ่มสุดขรึมเข้มค่อยๆ เปลี่ยนตัวเองไปเป็นพนักงานโรงแรม แบบที่เจ้าตัวก็รู้ตัวด้วยนะว่าตนเองเปลี่ยนไป
ส่วนหญิงสาวก็โชว์ความช่างสังเกตและไหวพริบในการช่วยสืบคดี
เรียกว่าเป็นคู่หูกันไปโดยปริยาย โดยทิ้งพื้นที่ให้คนอ่านลุ้นความสัมพันธ์ของคู่นี้อีกด้วย

ทั้งๆ ที่ทั้งเรื่องดำเนินเดินเรื่องอยู่แค่ในโรงแรม แต่ความหลากหลายของเนื้อเรื่อง และเวทมนตร์ของ Keigo ทำให้ไม่เบื่อเลย

นอกจากนี้ เบื้องลึกเบื้องหลังชีวิตพนักงานโรงแรม ผู้เขียนก็เอามาเล่าให้ฟังอย่างสนุก
เล่นรายละเอียดเรื่องพนักงานโรงแรมได้ดี ทั้งวิธีการคิด ความสัมพันธ์และการยืนหยัดต่อหน้าที่
หลายๆ อย่างคนนอกไม่มีทางจะมีไอเดียได้เลยว่าพนักงานโรงแรมต้องเผชิญกับอะไรบ้างในแต่ละวัน
ความเป็น “มืออาชีพ (professionalism)” ของพนักงานโรงแรม ถูกถ่ายทอดออกมาได้ดีเยี่ยม
อ่านเล่มนี้แล้ว มุมมองที่มีต่อพนักงานต้อนรับของโรงแรมเปลี่ยนไปจริงๆ

เรื่องนี้อ่านแล้วมันอึ้งว่า เฮ่ย ฆาตกรรม หรือการจองล้างจองผลาญกันโดยมีมูลเหตุจูงใจอย่างนี้ก็มีด้วยเหรอ
แถมการวางแผนฆาตกรรมที่วางเป็นพิกัดไว้ ก็ยังวางซะซับซ้อนจนชวนทึ่ง

review_1566649167,Nathania Ma,"Mar 02, 2016","Higashino Keigo has always been a pretty good mystery writer in Japan and he differs from the other authors because he is not confined to a single formula but tries out different styles. In Masquerade Hotel, a new series featuring Niita Kousuke and hotel receptionist Yamakishi Naomi, police deciphered a code, hinting the next murder would take place at the 5-star Hotel Cortesia. To arrest the suspect and prevent murder, Nitta, along with a small group of policemen, disguised as employees of the hotel. Yamakishi was assigned to train and support Nitta as the latter struggled to like a receptionist but she ended up helping him solve the case instead.

Masquerade Hotel is not your generic type of murder mystery where your hero or heroine is suddenly confronted with murder and somehow is thrown into a partnership with a law enforcement officer to solve the crime. Instead, it consists of a conglomerate of smaller plots from which the solution emerges. Reading Masquerade Hotel is like solving a puzzle, you don't quite see the picture until all the pieces are locked into place. The way Higashino structured the plot is extremely creative, unfortunately, the pacing is so slow that it easily erodes away the readers' interests.

Another flaw in this book is the characterization. At times, it is hard to believe an ordinary receptionist like Yamakishi has more deductive powers than experienced police officers. Of course, it is also strange Nitta will trust Yamakishi so easily and so utterly. There is a hint of romance in there but since this is the beginning of a series, perhaps we may see more of them later.

Some may find this book boring and may even DNF half way but I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to readers who don't mind trying a new style of mystery.",4,5 likes,54

ถ้าไม่คิดว่าอ่านนิยายคุณโงะอยู่ เรานึกว่ากำลังอ่านตำรา 'แนวปฏิบัติตัวต่อลูกค้าสำหรับพนักงานต้อนรับส่วนหน้าของโรงแรม' เลยล่ะค่ะ พรั่งพร้อมด้วย case study วิธีรับมือลูกค้าเจ้าปัญหาเอาใจยาก(ยากจนเหวอ) พร้อมประโยคมารยาทงามเปลี่ยนลูกค้าจอมเจ้าเล่ห์ให้กลายเป็นแฟนคลับของโรงแรม!

เราไม่เคยเจอพนักงานฟอนต์ท็อปฟอร์มขนาดคุณนาโอมิ แต่คิดว่าคนทำงานโรงแรมก็คงเจอลูกค้าเจ้าปัญหาระดับนี้กันมามากไม่ใช่น้อย

เล่มนี้อ่านชิลล์ๆ ค่ะ เหมือนอ่านหนังสือเมาท์มอยรวมประสบการณ์ลูกค้าประหลาดที่มาพักในโรงแรมให้ฟัง เรื่องสืบสวนสอบสวนไม่ได้เด่นแบบซีรีย์กาลิเลโอ ไม่ดราม่า ไม่สวีท ไม่ทริลเล่อร์ มีตรงพาร์ทแอ็คชั่นที่ตื่นเต้นใช้ได้ค่ะ :-)

อ่านจนจบก็ยังไม่เข้าใจว่าตุ๊กตาเด็กญี่ปุ่นมีรอยร้าวบนหน้าปกนี่จะสื่ออะไร... เป็นการเปรียบเปรยเชิงสัญลักษณ์ใช่ไหม? แต่ปกน่ากลัวมากค่ะ ขณะที่ในเล่มเอิงเอยมากจ้ะ

อ่านจบแล้วอ่านอะไรต่อดี?
นึกถึงบ่วงหงส์ของคุณกิ่งฉัตรค่ะ นางเอกเป็นลูกคุณหนูตกอับ เลยต้องมาทำงานโรงแรมค่ะ :-)",4,,54

สมมุติมีคะเเนนเต็มพันนึงอยากให้สักล้านนึง 55555

คือไม่รู้สิ สมความรอคอยอะ สมที่เรารอให้สนพ.ในบ้านเราเอางานอ.มาแปลอีก
ที่ดีใจมาก ๆ คือสนพ.ที่เอามาเเปลเป็นสนพ.น้ำพุด้วย เพราะมือถึง แปลดี บก.ดี แถมราคาดีต่อไตสุด ๆ

เราอ่านเล่มนี้จบในเวลา 2-3 ชม.
ตามสไตล์อ.เคโงะเขาเลยล่ะ
คือตั้งต้นด้วยคดีก่อน จากนั้นเล่าจากมุมมองของคนอื่น ๆ ซึ่งก็คือตำรวจและพนักงานโรงแรม เรื่องไม่เน้นกาาฆ่ากัน ไม่มีการบรรยายโหด ๆ หรืออะไรที่สยดสยองสักนิด เรียกได้ว่าห่างไกลจากฉากโหด ๆ เลือดสาดไปหลายร้อยโยชน์เลยทีเดียวเชียว

เรื่องจะถูกถ่ายทอดจากตัวละครในเรื่องที่เป็นคนอื่นในคดี คือไม่ใช่เหยื่อ/ญาติเหยื่อหรือฆาตกร แต่จะเล่าว่าตำรวจและพนักงานโรงเเรมช่วยกันรับมือกับคดีที่กำลังจะเกิดได้ยังไง
ในเเต่ละตอนยังคงเเฝงความดำมืดในจิตใจมนุษย์และสังคมในปัจจุบันได้ตามมาตรฐานอ.เคโงะ เเต่เล่มนี้จะไม่หนักหนา ไม่ชวนให้รู้สึกอึดอัดคับข้องใจเหมือนเรื่องก่อน ๆ แต่คนอ่านจะรู้สึกร่วมไปด้วยได้โดยง่าย เพราะเรื่องดำเนินไว เล่าสนุกและไม่เครียดมากจนเกินจะรับไหว


เเต่.... เอาจริง ๆ นะ หน้าปกนี่หลอกมาก!
ใครที่คิดว่าจะหาฉากหลอนโหด ๆ เลือดสาดเสียวไส้ อ่านเเล้วสยองปนเเขยงนี่ลืมไปได้เลย!!!
ส่วนใครที่กลัวปก ขอให้ตั้งสติ มองข้ามไปแล้วหยิบเล่มนี้มาอ่านเถอะ มันดีมาก ๆ นะ และสนุกมาก ๆ ด้วย
นอกจากจะให้เเง่คิดในการใช้ชีวิต รวมไปจนถึงทำให้คนอ่านอย่างเรา ๆ ได้ลุ้นไปกับการพัฒนาความสัมพันธ์ของตัวละครได้จริง ๆ คืออ่านแล้วเข้าใจเลยว่าคนเราสามารถเติบโตขึ้นได้จริง ๆ เพราะอ่านเล่มนี้แล้วรู้สึกอย่างนั้น เนื่องจากตัวละครหลักสองตัวมีเรื่องจำเป็นที่ทำให้ต้องปรับตัวเข้าหากันค่อนข้างมากด้วย

อ่านจบแล้วรู้สึกว่า งานเเต่ละงานมีความยากง่ายในตัวของมันเองจริง ๆ ไม่ว่าจะเป็นงานตำรวจสืบสวนหรือพนักงานโรงเเรม คนเรามีอุปสรรคต่าง ๆ เป็นของตัวเองด้วยกันทั้งนั้น แต่ทั้งนี้ก็ขึ้นอยู่กับว่าเราจะสามารถฝ่าฟันอุปสรรคนั้น ๆ ไปได้ด้วยความพยายามและความอดทนของตัวเองหรือเปล่าก็เท่านั้น

อีกเรื่องที่ชอบคือเราชอบเคมีที่เข้ากันของพระเอกนางเอกเรื่องนี้สุด ๆๆๆๆๆๆๆ พระเอกกับนางเอกเก่งแล้วก็ฉลาดด้วยกันทั้งคู่ แต่เป็นความฉลาดและความถนัดในสายงานของตัวเอง ซึ่งตรงนี้อ่านแล้วไม่ได้น่ารำคาญแต่อย่างใดนะ เเต่เขียนออกมาได้กลมกล่อมลงตัวดี เเละเป็นเสน่ห์อย่างหนึ่งของเรื่องนี้ที่เราชอบเอามาก ๆ เลยแหละ

เพราะงั้น... สายชอบหนังสือสืบสวนญี่ปุ่นควรไปหามาอ่านเถอะนะ มันดีจริง ๆ


ปล. เรื่องนี้ใช้วิธีดำเนินเรื่องคล้ายเรื่อง Shinzanmono มาก ๆๆๆๆๆ แต่เรื่องนี้ทำออกมาได้ดีกว่าและกระชับกว่า มาก ๆ


ปปล. ไม่ต้องเหนื่อยมานั่งเดาคนร้ายในเรื่องนะ เดาไม่ถูกหรอก จริง ๆ เชื่อเราเถอะ 555555
อ่านแบบสบาย ๆ ดีกว่า เพราะสนุกกกกกมวากกกกกก",5,,54
review_4457598872,Nguyet Minh,"Jan 09, 2022","Một vụ án không hề gay cấn nhưng lại khá thú vị. Toàn bộ câu chuyện và vụ án chỉ diễn ra ở một địa điểm duy nhất, đó là khách sạn hạng sang Cortesia Tokyo vì đó chính là địa điểm mà hung thủ của 3 vụ án trước để lại dưới dạng mật mã. Nhiệm vụ của cảnh sát là phải tìm ra hung thủ trước khi hắn gây án tại đây. Không man rợ kịch tính, không thủ đoạn lắt léo, không đánh đấm rượt đuổi, chỉ là vận dụng sự thông minh chỉn chu để thực hiện sự trả thù có phần gượng ép, khó mà hả dạ và thỏa mãn cho chính hung thủ nhưng lại gây võ đoán hoang mang cho phía điều tra.

Đội cảnh sát nằm vùng cắm chốt tại Cortesia suốt 1 tuần, nhiệm vụ chính của họ chỉ là quan sát, phân tích rồi khoanh vùng. Với độc giả nôn nóng thì có lẽ câu chuyện có vẻ hơi lê thê, thiếu trọng tâm, nghĩa là khá xa rời việc điều tra. Nhưng nếu để ý kỹ sẽ thấy ý đồ khéo léo của Keigo. Lúc nào cũng vậy, Keigo luôn mượn việc điều tra để nhằm nhấn mạnh những vấn đề khác của cuộc sống: đó là vấn đề tâm lý của con người, sự ô nhiễm đạo đức của các tầng lớp, sự thoái hoá của xã hội…Còn ở đây, khách sạn là địa điểm duy nhất mà toàn bộ tổ điều tra có mặt xuyên suốt đã trở thành nơi học nghề cho cảnh sát và ngược lại, cho toàn bộ nhân viên khách sạn. Nếu Yamagishi Naomi đại diện cho chất lượng dịch vụ đỉnh cao của khách sạn Nhật thì Nitta đại diện cho sự nhạy bén, tinh tường cùng khả năng phân tích và phản ứng điệu nghệ của cảnh sát Nhật. Hai nhân vật ấy có những màn tung hứng về đối đáp lẫn hành động tưởng khác biệt nhưng rất đồng điệu, họ truyền thống trong trách nhiệm và hiện đại trong hành động thực tế.

Lồng ghép trong quá trình phá án là rất nhiều gương mặt được gắn mác “nghi phạm”. Ta có thể thấy bất cứ ai cũng có những vấn đề của riêng mình, có thể là sự phiền toái, cơn giận nhất thời hoặc mối thù qua năm tháng, sự mặc cảm tự ti và cả nỗi cô đơn lẫn thói ngạo mạn. Tất cả được pha trộn trong vỏ bọc xã hội nhưng mặt trái của nó chính là sự tan vỡ trong hôn nhân, thất bại trong sự nghiệp, cô đơn trong cuộc sống…Khách sạn là nơi dung chứa toàn bộ những mảnh ghép cuộc đời đó dưới dạng chi trả và phục vụ, miễn hỏi. Ai cũng có vẻ đáng nghi, rồi trở nên đáng trách và đáng thương.

Vụ án kết thúc với cú xoay chuyển khá tài tình. Không bàn đến việc dễ hay khó đoán hung thủ và động cơ gây án, Keigo xử lý bước ngoặt khá khéo léo, không quá ngỡ ngàng nhưng không quá xuề xòa cho xong. Đọc sách ngỡ như đang học ngành dịch vụ khách sạn tận Tokyo vậy. Chất Keigo trong vụ án này có phần tươi mới, khá tây phương, hóm hỉnh. Mọi tình tiết đơn giản nhưng hợp lý và một Keigo vô cùng lãng mạn đã hiện ra ở dòng cuối cuốn sách: “Naomi cũng nâng ly của mình lên. Cảnh đêm Tokyo ánh lên trong hai ly rượu vừa chạm vào nhau.”",4,,54

Lấy bối cảnh là khách sạn sang trọng ngay giữa Tokyo bị chọn làm địa điểm gây án sắp tới trong 1 vụ giết người hàng loạt, nên cảnh sát phải trà trộn vào nằm vùng làm việc cùng nhân viên khách sạn, câu chuyện kể về những người khách với những bí mật riêng của mình. Ai cũng có vẻ đáng nghi, nhưng đồng thời cũng đáng thương trong những ám ảnh đau buồn và lòng hận thù âm ỉ cùng năm tháng. Mỗi người có mặt nạ của mình, khách sạn tuy sang trọng nhưng là địa điểm của lễ hội hoá trang ấy, nơi xoay vần giữa những nạn nhân và thể hiện ra góc tăm tối sâu kín của họ.

Truyện hay và lôi cuốn, vẫn mang văn phong đặc trưng của nhà văn Nhật mà mình luôn thích.",4,3 likes,54

Toii đang gõ những dòng này ngay sau khi gấp lại cuốn sách. Phải viết liền tay trước khi con tym thiếu nữ trở lại với nhịp đập bình thường hê hê.

Khách Sạn Mặt Nạ - một cái tựa cực kỳ đắt giá cho vụ án lần này. Dù rằng án mạng không được xếp vào mục ly kỳ, hấp dẫn, bánh cuốn (do tui bình chọn), nhưng những câu chuyện nhỏ lẻ xuất hiện xuyên suốt cuốn sách khiến tui phải dừng lại để suy ngẫm. Thí dụ, trong vụ khách hàng cáu bẳn kỳ quặc Kurihara, đề cập đến vấn nạn ""bạo lực tinh thần"" giữa học sinh và giáo viên thực tập. Câu chuyện tuy chỉ là thoáng qua giữa chuỗi ngày nằm vùng phá án, nhưng tâm lý nhân vật được thể hiện rất chân thực: ""Chính vì chẳng có chút ý thức nào về tội lỗi nên anh mới thấy thất vọng về bản thân."" Chủ đề này không hề rời xa thực tế vì chính tui đã từng chứng kiến một cảnh tương tự như rứa. Và tui thích cách sensei thêm thắt vài khía cạnh tâm lý như vầy nè.

Phải kể đến điều làm tui cực kỳ phấn khích khi ngụp lặn trong tác phẩm này. Chất xúc tác không nằm ở yếu tố trinh thám như thường lệ, mà nằm ở cách tạo dựng hình tượng bộ đôi nam nữ chính của Keigo. Đây hẳn là tác phẩm đầu tiên của sensei mà tui được trải qua cảm giác lên thuyền đu couple :)) Nghe qua thiệt ngớ ngẩn, nhưng sự thật là vậy đấy. Nitta, cậu cảnh sát hình sự trẻ tuổi, thông minh và tài giỏi. Cùng Naomi, cô nhân viên lễ tân khách sạn giỏi giang và có óc quan sát sắc sảo. Hai con người ưu tú gặp nhau trong một phi vụ bí mật của cảnh sát, và... Họ chẳng cần trao nhau lời tình thương mến thương nào. Chỉ cần họ đứng đó với nhau thôi, chemistry đã tung tóe tràn bìa sách rồi. U là trời, thứ lỗi cho máu ngôn tình của tui đột nhiên trỗi dậy không đúng chỗ; nhưng rõ ràng với sự chuyển biến trong tâm lý, hành động, lời nói, ánh mắt của họ, tui không thể nào đứng yên được :v Hãy để con tym này được hét lên cho thỏa nỗi lòng haha.

Sensei vẫn luôn là sensei, lợi hại trong đa vũ trụ. Keigo ở vũ trụ lãng mạn có sức hấp dẫn không thua gì Keigo ở vũ trụ án mạng đâu nhaaa.

Và tui rate 5☆ vì tất cả những điều đã kể lể ở trên.",5,3 likes,54

review_2146956118,Lorna,"Oct 08, 2017","Guests came to hotel for a masquerade party--- that's probably only the case in Japan since there is no requirement by law to validate a guest's identity when checking in. Hotel is then no longer a place to sleep for travellers. Instead it became a place that attracts people who want to disguise themselves for various purposes. The job for staff of the hotel is to look through the masquerade but pretend that they haven't, and then balance different guests' purposes if there are any conflicts. The job for police is to look through and the masquerade, pull it off and find out the criminal. A great cooperation between a waitress and a policemen under the masquerade. At the end of the day it is not only the guests that at in disguise but everyone.
这一部东野圭吾一定是花了心思写的，虽然还是有一点点新参者那样想用独立小故事凑起来的痕迹，但总体而言“独立小故事”之间的联系非常紧密。至少都指向了最终破案的方向。结局也不是“为了讨读者欣喜而找了个边缘人物当罪犯”，但我也依旧没猜出来🤣。作者非常善于制造氛围，这点和他以往任何作品一样。总而言之～好看！",4,1 like,54
review_4435799226,Đọc Gì Hong?,"Feb 16, 2022","Đọc nhiều sách của chú bạn sẽ dần được biết hình ảnh ẩn dụ đến từ tựa sách sau những lúc gần phá án. 2 quyển này cũng như vậy. Nhưng mà mình mong chờ nhiều hơn, mình mong chờ nghĩa đen luôn chứ mạch truyện 2 quyển này cũng hơi dài dòng, hơi tâm lí nhiều quá, mình đọc lại có cảm giác hơi mệt mệt.. :)) Chắc xong 2 quyển này mình sẽ chọn trinh thám giật gân hơn. :))

Về 2 quyển này, mình đọc quyển màu đỏ bên phải trước. Và mình có thấy người đời đồn là tác giả hong cho đánh số 2 quyển sách để người đọc đọc quyển nào cũng được. Nhưng cá nhân mình nghĩ, nên đọc quyển đỏ trước vì đoạn cuối chắc chắn làm bạn tò mò sẽ dẫn đến quyển sau - đối với mình là vậy. Quyển đỏ thì là những mẩu chuyện trinh thám của anh cảnh sát mới vào nghề cũng 1 cô tiếp tân quản lí khách sạn theo mình đánh giá là siêu nhiều chuyện nha cả nhà :)))). Đồng ý là nhân viên phải để ý để “chăm sóc” khách hàng 1 cách chu đáo nhất nhưng mà nó cứ sao á. :)) Nhưng mà này bối cảnh ở Nhật, nơi mọi thứ kể cả, câu nệ nên chắc là vậy ròi. Hong biết chất lượng dịch vụ ở ngoài có giống trong sách hong, mà cũng phải thôi, này khách sạn 5 sao - nơi khách hàng chắc chắn là thượng đế à. Nói chung quyển này thì mỗi vụ án hong liên quan cho lắm. Vụ thứ 2 cũng được, cũng có 1 chút twist, khá ổn áp. Quyển này hay quyển sau đều lên án sự trọng nam khinh nữ - mà mình thấy là dù bất cứ ở đâu hay bất cứ ngành nghề nào cũng sẽ có chuyện này thoi, nhưng Nhật thì đúng là vậy thiệt - nơi định kiến xã hội càng mạnh mẽ và gay gắt hơn, nơi phụ nữ chỉ là “cánh hậu cần” cho đàn ông.

Sang đến quyển 2 thì dẫn dắt của chú khiến mình đã mong chờ vô cùng nhưng cuối cùng cũng hong đẩy lên cao trào cực điểm lắm. :)) Chắc do đánh mạnh tâm lí nhân vật nên động cơ giết người nghiên về tâm lí nhiều hơn. Thì sang quyển 2 cũng như nội dung tóm tắt, Context là 1 vụ giết người hàng loạt sẽ xảy ra ở khách sạn của nữ chính quyển 1 làm tiếp tân, xong anh cảnh sát quyển 1 nằm vùng ở ks để điều tra, đại loại thế. Ròi. Cũng như quyển 1, thì cũng có mấy case nhỏ nhỏ liên quan đến nghiệp vụ xử lý khách hàng ở ngành lễ tân khách sạn như bùng tiền, chiêu trò của khách muốn đổi phòng, các kiểu các kiểu, cũng ổn, nhưng nhiều quá đâm ra mất hay. Cái hay ở quyển này mình nghĩ, là dù bạn có bực bội mong chờ đến cao trào đỉnh điểm lắm, nhưng bạn phải cố đọc hết và hong bỏ sót 1 case nhỏ nhỏ nào đang diễn ra trong cuốn sách, nó càng khiến bạn tò mò, và để ý đến những mẩu chuyện nhỏ nhất cùng những nhân vật xuất hiện. Quay lại, nếu bạn đọc quyển đỏ ròi, thì bạn sẽ đâu đó sẽ nghĩ có chút tương đồng với vụ quyển này, nhưng cũng khá ít. Mình thích cái twist của quyển đỏ hơn. Cá nhân mình thấy, cô lễ tân này quá yêu nghề, ngoài đời hong biết có người nào tâm huyết đến vậy hong nữa, nhiều khi đâm ra phi thực tế. :))

Đánh giá khách quan, mình hong thích 2 quyển này cho lắm. Tuýp nhân vật cũng hong khiến mình đặc biệt thích, vì hình tượng anh cảnh sát này tự cao quá, còn cô lễ tân thì xét nét với ảo quá. Với có nhiều quan điểm dù nhỏ thôi nhưng mình hong đồng ý lắm nên mình hong thích Điểm cộng là mình thích cách hung thủ xây dựng, lập kế hoạch gây ra vụ án, động cơ giết người cũng được. Không phải là chuyện cỏn con, đôi khi chính chúng ta nghĩ là mình đang đồng cảm với nỗi đau người khác, nhưng hong thể nào biết được đôi khi chỉ là những điều nhỏ nhặt nhất sẽ khiến người ta đau đớn và tổn thương và kí ức tồi tệ đi theo mãi, kiểu vậy.

Rating 2⭐️ thì cũng hong đến nỗi. 3⭐️ thì cảm giác chưa đúng lắm nhưng vì tác giả xây dựng câu chuyện ổn. Nên 3⭐️ cho cả 2 quyển.",3,0 likes,54

스토리는 간단하게 주인공 둘, 나오미랑 닛타가, 호텔 잔입을 하는 이야기이다. 살인을 잡기위해. 둘의 셩격은 많이 달라서 티격태격하지만 나중에는 둘을 존중하며 범인을 잡는 이야기였다.

읽으면서 느낀건, 아.. 왜 이렇게 질질 끄나 였다. 자꾸나오는 별 상관없는 이야기. 상관이 정말 없는건 아니었지만 그래도 뭔가.. 범인을 잡기 위해서 보다는 이런사람들도 있구나 라는 생각이 들었다.

끝을 읽을땐. 아.. 나도 무의식적으로 사람에게 상처를 줬겠구나 라는 생각을 했다. 그리고 조금 아쉬운 부분도 있었다. 왜냐하면 두 주인공들의 관계가 어떻게 되었는지 않가르쳐주어서. 그점이 속상했다.

다시 이책을 생각하면 호텔에서는.. 아니.. 우리주변에서는 모두 가면을 쓰고 다닌다는걸 다시 한번 느끼게 된거 같다. 그걸 어떻게 보는지는 나의 결정이라는 것도. 나둘지 아니면 벗길건지.

나는 이책을 빌렸다. 그리고 지금은 사고 싶은생각은 없다. 만약에 사게된다면 아마 중간을 읽을꺼 같다. 내가 상상도 하지 못한 사람을 접하고 싶어서. 하지만 끝까지는 무리일꺼 같다.",4,1 like,54
review_4795410745,hai tran,"Jun 20, 2022","Minor Higashino. Would not recommend.

This is the first time I've seen the author explore a seemingly straightforward case of serial murder. And the story takes place entirely at a hotel, a closed off environment with its own sets of rules and all kind of secrets and hidden corners. The central relationship is between a receptionist and a policeman, strangers with clashing personalities bounded together by chance and murder. What hijinks will they be up to?! This set-up seems to have lots of potential to my mind. Possibilities abound! So I was all in.

Alas the execution really let me down. The story turns out to be a drag with a bunch of dead-end subplots that are only distantly related to the main storyline, populated by characters who are as unmemorable as they are annoying. One subplot revolves around a man who was acting so preposterously to the hotel staff for no reason that I it got on my nerve. Maybe the author was going a different route, not only telling the story of the crime but also showing the lives of people going in and out of the hotel, how they are 'wearing masks' and 'masquerading' their true intents. That kind of slice-of-life stories can be interesting. But their intents are so mundane and told in such a bland way that I couldn't care less about those guests and their lives, especially when they get in the way of the main crime. (The laziness in the writing really showed. There are many repetitions in phrases and descriptions throughout. If I take a shot every time someone 'laugh miserably', I'd be dead from alcohol poisoning.)
I kept reading just because I was waiting for a twist deserving of this author. Like the ending of Naoko which absolutely tied the whole thing together and made it all worth it. I came to Higashino for moments like those. But he didn't deliver with this one. The criminal, usually so unforgettable in Higashino's work, is left totally underdeveloped in this case. The payoff isn't worth slogging through this meandering tale.

The whole thing feels like a police procedure, but with 100% more boring meeting and arguing over procedural stuff and who is the better police. Which brings me to our main character, who we are told over and over is an excellent police because he solved some super tough crime a while back, apparently that gives him the right to be full of himself and act like he is the smartest guy in the world. He is always so surprised whenever someone else can think of the same thing he can. But his arrogance is not an obstacle to solving the crime because his sidekicks (the receptionist girl and another conveniently selfless policeman) are always ready to help him even though he thinks they are a nuisance and nag them all the time. The reason they kept helping him: because he is the type of person that makes people want to help. Yes, that is the reason stated in the book. I had to laugh.",2,0 likes,54

Nói về cái duyên với bác Keigo thì mình tình cờ biết đến bác qua cuốn Điều kỳ diệu của tiệm tạp hóa Namiya. Nhưng thực ra thì lúc đó mình cũng đã biết Higashino Keigo là ai đâu. Bắt đầu đọc cuốn đó chỉ vì chiếc bìa được thiết kế thực sự rất thu hút, đọc lời tựa cũng thấy có mang yếu tố kì ảo thấy hay hay nên là mình chọn đọc thôi. Sau này cứ như một cái duyên ấy, mình cứ dần đọc được nhiều bài review, nhiều bài ngưỡng mộ sự tài ba trong các tác phẩm trinh thám của bác nên cũng mày mò tìm đọc thêm. Cho đến nay, số truyện của bác Keigo ngày càng tăng trên giá sách mình cũng chính minh được cho sự u mê của mình đối với các tác phẩm của bác rùi.
Quay lại với cuốn truyện lần này, Khách sạn mặt nạ - phần 1, thì phải nói lại là một tác phẩm xuất sắc nữa của tác giả. Tình huống truyện từ ban đầu đã không dài dòng mà vào thẳng vấn đề luôn, rất dễ để độc giả có thể nắm được tình hình và mạch truyện sẽ diễn biến ra sao. Nói là dễ để hiểu bắt mạch truyện ra sao thôi, chứ để biết được phần tiếp theo tác giả lại lái độc giả đi tới đâu thì chưa bao giờ mình làm được trong các tác phẩm của bác Keigo cả, và tác phẩm này cũng vậy. Dù mình cũng thỉnh thoảng đoán này đoán kia xem có đoán ra được hung thủ có thể là kẻ nào không, mà cứ y như rằng bị cuốn theo cách kể chuyện của tác giả rồi bị đánh lừa lúc nào thật không hay. Thế rồi đến lúc hung thủ xuất hiện thì chỉ có thể ồ, à lên mà thôi. Có thể nói tác giả là bậc thầy trong việc kết nối những sự việc tưởng chừng rời rạc lại thành một chuỗi những sự kiện hợp lý đến cực kì .
Nếu như ở tác phẩm Phía sau nghi can X, độc giả đã được biết cơ bản về tội phạm và vụ án chính cũng đã xảy ra, thì ở tác phẩm này hung thủ thực sự vẫn chưa hề xuất hiện và tên đó vẫn đang ủ mưu và sắp sửa tiến hành vụ án tiếp theo. Sự đấu trí giữa đội cảnh sát hùng hậu và tên sát nhân vẫn đang ở trong bóng tối thực sự làm độc giả như mình hồi hộp và lo lắng trong từng câu từng chữ, đặc biệt là đoạn lên cao trào. Thật là một sự tài tình của bác Keigo, khi từng diễn biến qua câu chữ cứ hiện lên như đang xem một bộ phim thật vậy.
Một điểm làm mình thích thú ở truyện này nữa đó là mối quan hệ của hai nhân vật chính Nitta và Naomi. Thực sự thì cũng chẳng có chemistry gì to to ở hai nhân vật này đâu, cũng toàn là trò chuyện về công việc rồi các vụ án vậy thôi. Cơ mà ở đây mình thấy vui bởi vì hai con người này đều rất thông minh và nghiệm túc với công việc của mình làm. Mặc dù ban đầu hai người như hai đầu nam châm cùng dấu khi ai cũng tỏ ra ngang ngạnh trong cách đối xử với người kia, nhưng sau dần chính sự tử tế và trí thông minh đã kết nối họ lại gần với nhau để rồi có thể tạo thành một cặp đôi ăn ý, cũng nhờ một phần vào đó mà vụ án có thể phá giải êm đẹp.
À nói đến cái tên của tác phẩm một chút nhỉ, do có đọc tựa đề của cuốn còn lại nên mình cứ ngỡ rằng mạch truyện cả 2 cuốn sẽ xoay quanh một lễ hội hóa trang nào đó, nơi đó toàn bộ khách sẽ phải đeo mặt nạ, rồi thủ phạm sẽ có thể ra tay ở một nơi thần thần bí bí như vậy. Nhưng mà giả thiết đó của mình sai bét. Cuốn 1 này chẳng có một lễ hội, vũ hội gì ở đây cả. Mặt nạ ở đây chính là một bộ mặt khác mà mỗi vị khách khi tới khách sạn này sẽ mang lên, có thể là vì lý do cá nhân thực sự vô hại, nhưng cũng có thể đằng sau chiếc mặt nạ vô hại lại là một tên sát nhân đang ủ mưu cho một vụ án chấn động.
Nếu phải nói một điểm mà khiến mình ""bất tiện"" hoặc không thích lắm ở cuốn Khách sạn mặt nạ này, thì đó là: Có quá nhiều cái tên. Tên thì nhiều mà lại còn dài, đã thế còn tùy hoàn cảnh mà tác giả sử dụng tên hay là họ của nhân vật. Vậy nên điều này khiến mình thỉnh thoảng ngớ ra, phải nhớ lại xem nhân vật này là ai, nằm trong mắt xích nào đây. Nhưng cũng nhờ cú đọc thần tốc trong 2 ngày nên may mắn mình dễ dàng nắm lại mạch truyện, không bị quên béng hay mất công phải đi tìm lại những cái tên đó.
Kết lại là một cuốn trinh thám hay nên đọc, cũng xác lập kỉ lục mới của Quỳnh Anh là đọc cuốn sách gần 500 trang chỉ trong 2 ngày, lại còn vượt lười viết được kha khá cảm nhận sau khi đọc xong một cuốn sách. Khá khen cho QA ^^.",5,0 likes,54

review_4636361211,Lý Nguyễn,"Mar 29, 2022","Hotel Mask
A serial murder occurs in Tokyo. The suspect and next target are unknown, so the police had to track down the only clue left by the perpetrator and that was at the 5-star Cortesia Tokyo hotel.
The story is built by the author around the two opposite extremes of the two professions as a receptionist and a police officer, seemingly opposing each other, but in fact, both complement each other's shortcomings. The book does not have many detective details, most of which are everyday stories that hotel staff often encounter. Although not too attractive, it is also not boring that makes people give up halfway.
After reading both books The Mask Hotel will give each of us an insight into life, sympathy, deep empathy for people, and the good points of our profession.",5,0 likes,54
review_3075594794,Bh,"Dec 06, 2019","** spoiler alert ** The book shows a different side to be a staffer in a hotel. There is two mainlines in the story, one of them is to handle the case, and one of them is to show how hard to be a qualified front desk staff. I think it is very interesting to stand-in a different point of view to look at the job as reception staff. It is not only the guests who are wearing a mark, but also the character's colleague(or everyone). The murder, the colleague and the guests are all wearing a mask, some of them are well and some of them are evil. Some of them even have multiple masks, such as the murder. First, we thought she is a kind and amiable lady, but since we know she is the murder who planned the whole thing, we thought she is evil and cruel, but under her second mask, is her broken heart and some experiences that we never know. Everyone is wearing a mask, but it might not be a bad thing, because that is life itself. It is unnecessary to unmask those hypocritical masks. It does show human nature in some way. The ending is well-connected with the front. It contains lots of logic. I like this book.",0,0 likes,54

คือมันก็อ่านสนุกหละ แต่เราคิดว่าหนังสือมันสามารถบางลงได้อีก
ถ้าตัดช่วงที่มันไม่เกี่ยวกับคดีในเรื่อง ซึ่งที่เราได้อ่านค่อนเล่มคึือการมาสาธยาย
ชีวิตประจำวันของ พนง โรงแรม มันสนุกมั้ย? ใช่ มันสนุก อ่านเพลินมาก
แต่จุดประสงค์ของเราคือการมาอ่านการสืบสวนคดี ความคืบหน้าของคดี
ซึ่งกว่าจะเข้าเรืองกว่าจะมีอะไรคืบหน้าในคดี ก็ปาไป 60% ของเล่ม


ส่วนปมของตัวฆาตกรเอง ก็ถือว่าไมไ่ด้เบาหวิวอะไร น่าคล้อยตามอยู่
ซึ่งพออ่านถึงจุดที่เฉลยแล้ว เราก็เข้าใจแล้วว่า ไอที่มาให้อ่านเรื่องงานของ
พนง โรงแรมเนี่ย มันมีเหตผลของมัน แต่บางช่วงมันก็เป็นท้ำท่วมทุ่งจริงๆนั่นแหละ

สรุป

สนุก ถ้าอ่านแบบไมไ่ด้คาดหวังอะไรเลย แต่เราคาดหวังในตัวคดี คาดหว้งเรื่องการสืบสวน
ก็เลยเฟลนิดๆ ที่มาเน้นแต่เรื่องในโรงแรม แต่ตอนจบก็ถือว่าทำได้ดี",4,0 likes,54
review_4673988860,Hà Đức,"Apr 24, 2022","** spoiler alert ** Tôi thấy hay và vote 5⭐️/5 cho tập 1 này.

1. Không biết là lỗi dịch hay lỗi từ bản gốc:
- Trong phần 5, Yamamoto Nose đến khách sạn thuê phòng 1050;
- Trong phần 7, YN muốn nhường cho Nitta dùng phòng mình thuê thì Nitta lại lên ở phòng 1015
=> Ai lú ở đây nhỉ? Tác giả? Dịch giả? Hay Độc giả? Tức là tui???

2. Khả năng phán đoán của Nitta hơi được thần thánh hoá, mọi phán đoán dù mông lung, không có cơ sở nhưng đều đúng 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️

3. Tóm tắt lại một chút, có spoil nội dung mạnh đấy nhé:
- Nagakura Maki có bầu với Matsuoka, bị chối bỏ, đến khách sạn tìm (khi Mat đi tuyển diễn viên) thì bị Naomi ngăn cản (do nguyên tắc bảo vệ khách hàng của lễ tân). Ở ngoài trời lạnh cả đêm (chờ sáng ra Mat xuất hiện), Maki sảy thai nảy sinh thù hằn, muốn giết Matsuoka & Naomi.
- Thực tế, đây là 5 vụ án đơn nhưng thủ phạm tụ tập nhau trên web đen và giả vờ là giết người hàng loạt (4 vụ) bằng cách để lại mật mã ở hiện trường vụ án, vụ trước lộ địa điểm, ngày diễn ra vụ sau. Vì thủ phạm lập luận rằng, cảnh sát phải tìm được điểm chung/ thủ phạm có mối thù hằn chung với cả 4 nạn nhân thì mới ra tay cả loạt như vậy, điều này làm khó cảnh sát vì thực tế các nạn nhân lẫn thủ phạm không có mối liên hệ gì rõ ràng. (Ủa mà sao không nghĩ đến trường hợp thủ phạm bị điên khùng giết người ngẫu nhiên nhỉ???)
- Vụ thứ 5 thực tế đã diễn ra từ trước, Maki dự định giết Mat và Naomi nên muốn nguỵ trang vụ giết Naomi thành 1 trong số các vụ giết người hàng loạt.",5,0 likes,54

The main character is a girl working as a high-end hostess with the dream of marrying someone rich. One time, at a gig entertaining guests of a high-end jeweller, someone dies at the party. So the girl has to assist the cops to solve the case and gets pulled into something much bigger than she expected. As with Higashino's previous books, I learned some new stuff about the hostess culture in Japan and also about jewellery? The motive isn't as far-fetched this time and the moral lesson element also isn't that strong so I don't have any complaint.",3,1 like,55

review_1627081823,Sophie,"May 02, 2016","Yeah, okay, so this was kinda cool.

For obvious reasons people at work have a tendency to push books by Japanese authors onto me (if I am not drawn to them myself), and after having read one of this authors books before I tried to read some of his other releases but never quite got into them. When I took a peak at this one, though, I was intrigued (and amused at the ""their parents were killed in a car accident"" trope which seems to come up in just about every second Japanese novel I read). And to be honest, it is taking all of my willpower to not order all of this authors books from my trusted Japanese online shop NOW.

The subtitle is actually misleading, because it's not Detective Kaga who is solving the case, it's you. The reader. And while you get hints, you won't find the solution inside the book, which may not be for everyone. You can try googling - in Japanese I found the result I was looking for, but I think if you take the time and look at the aspects mentioned in the hints it's possible to find it.

In either case, it's definitely a nice change to the other crime books you find. I also enjoyed the way it was told, and looking back certain things that made me go, Huh, the first time now make sense which actually is all kinds of cool if you ask me.

Whether now or later (maybe after reading that OTHER Japanese crime novel I just started), I really do need to read more by Higashino Keigo. And maybe other Japanese crime authors as well. Good thing I already can read the language :D",4,4 likes,57

review_3028146470,Niran Pravithana,"Oct 28, 2019","เอาจริงๆ ชื่อในภาษาญี่ปุ่น แปลตรงตัวว่า ""ฉันฆ่าเขา"" เป็นพลอตเรื่องที่แปลก ที่เล่าเรื่องการฆาตกรรมชายหนุ่มนักเขียนชื่อดัง โดยมีผู้ต้องสงสัยหลายคน ที่ล้วนเชื่อว่า ตนเองเป็นคนที่ฆ่านักเขียน เพียงแต่ไม่ได้ลงมือเอง

แนวทางการเล่าเรื่องนั้น เคโงะ เล่าในรูปแบบผ่านบุคคลที่ 1 คือผู้ต้องสงสัยแต่ละคน สลับไปมาในแต่ละตอน เพื่อให้เราเห็นความคิด (เกือบ) ทั้งหมด ของผู้ต้องสงสัยแต่ละคน และทำให้เราอดคิดตามไปไม่ได้ว่า ใครกันแน่นะ ที่เป็นฆาตกร

สเน่ห์อย่างนึงของงานเขียนของฮิงาชิโนะ เคโงะ นอกจากเรื่องพลอตเรื่องแล้ว ผมคิดว่าคือเรื่องเกี่ยวกับประเด็น 'รักต้องห้าม' ที่ดึงดูดคนอ่านให้คล้อยตาม และเห็นอกเห็นใจคู่รัก จนเราเผลอหลงผิดไปว่าสิ่งที่พวกเค้าทำในหนังสือนั้นเป็นเรื่องที่ดีงาม

ไม่ว่าจะเป็น 夜明けの街で (ความลับนครรุ่งอรุณ) หรือ パラレルワールド・ラブストーリー (Parallel World Love Story) หรือในเล่มที่ผมเพิ่งอ่านล่าสุด 私が彼を殺した (ตายวันแต่ง)

ขึ้นชื่อว่าความรัก ถ้ามันเกิดขึ้นแล้วผมเชื่อว่ามันคือสิ่งที่สวยงาม ความรักแบบหนุ่มสาวของคนที่เป็นพี่น้องอาจจะดูเป็นเรื่องขยะแขยงน่ารังเกียจในมุมของสังคม แต่ถ้าเราเข้าใจความรู้สึกของเด็กกำพร้าสองคนที่โหยหาความอบอุ่น และต้องแยกจากกันไปยาวนานถึง 15 ปี กลับมาเจอกัน ต่อสู้ฝ่าฟันมาด้วยกัน จนกระทั่งตกหลุมรักซึ่งกันและกัน ผมว่ามันคือความสวยงามที่ไม่ควรถูกจารีตประเพณีมาทำให้มันกลายเป็นเรื่องที่น่ารังเกียจขยะแขยง

ผมจึงสงสารและเห็นใจมิวาโกะ กับทาคาฮิโระมากๆ และแอบลุ้นตลอดเรื่องว่าขออย่าให้ทาคาฮิโระเป็นฆาตกรเลย (แต่ที่ผมลุ้นจะสำเร็จมั้ย ไม่บอกนะครับ ไปอ่านกันเอง 5555)

มิวาโกะเลือกที่อยากจะหลุดพ้นจากความรักที่สังคมมองว่าวิปริต ทั้งๆ ที่ตัวเธอเองก็ยังคงรักทาคาฮิโระอยู่สุดหัวใจ การบรรยายของเคโงะในเรื่องความรู้สึกของมิวาโกะนั้น ตัวเคโงะไม่ได้บรรยายตรงๆ แต่ความ minimal ที่เคโงะเขียนนั้น กลับกระทบความรู้สึกผมตอนอ่านมากๆ

หลังจากนี้จะเป็นสปอย ใครยังไม่ได้อ่าน อย่าข้ามมาอ่านนะครับ แต่ใครอ่านแล้ว และสงสัยประเด็นฆาตกร ผมเขียนวิเคราะห์มุมมองของผมเอาไว้แล้ว

********************************************

สุดท้ายพลอตที่เคโงะเขียนใน 私が彼を殺した ปิดท้ายคล้ายๆ กับโคนัน คินดะอิจิ หรืองานเขียนของอกาธา คริสตี้ คือการจับผู้ต้องสงสัยทั้งหมดมาอยู่ด้วยกัน แล้วให้นักสืบเป็นคนค่อยๆ คลี่คลายคดี

แต่ความแปลกอีกอย่างที่แปลกมากๆ ของหนังสือเล่มนี้ คือ เคโงะไม่เฉลยฆาตกรในหนังสือ แต่ทิ้ง clue บางอย่างเอาไว้ แล้วปล่อยให้พวกเราผู้อ่านไปคิดกันเอาเองว่าใครกันแน่ที่เป็นฆาตกร

พูดตรงๆ ผมอ่านจบเมื่อคืนตอนตี 4 เสร็จแล้วเครียดมาก นอนไม่หลับ 55555 เพราะมัวแต่นั่งคิดว่าใครกันนะที่เป็นฆาตกร จนในที่สุดระหว่างขับรถกลับบ้านวันนี้ ก็ได้คำตอบ ปริศนาทั้งหมดของเคโงะถูกไขกระจ่างแล้ว..!!

ใครสงสัยเรื่องใครกันแน่นะที่เป็นฆาตกร ลองอ่านข้อสมมติฐานของผมดูนะครับ คิดเหมือนหรือต่างกันยังไงแลกเปลี่ยนกันได้

สิ่งที่นักสืบคางะแจ้งในตอนสุดท้ายคือ ในรูป 3 ใบนั้น มีของชิ้นนึงที่มีลายนิ้วมือของคนที่ไม่เกี่ยวข้องกับคดีอยู่ในนั้น รูปสามใบมี กล่องใส่ยา, ขวดยา และ กระเป๋าของมิวาโกะ

ผมตัดตัวเลือกขวดยาทิ้งไปก่อน เพราะบางคนอาจจะคิดว่ามีการสลับขวดยาของโฮดากะ กับขวดยาของจุนโกะ แต่ถ้าเราจำกันได้ ตอนสึงุระเข้าห้องจุนโกะนั้น เขาได้เช็ดลายนิ้วมือทั้งหมดออกจากขวดยาไปเรียบร้อยแล้ว ดังนั้นเป็นไปไม่ได้ที่จะมีการสลับขวดยาแล้วทำให้เจอลายนิ้วมือ 'ของใครซักคนที่ไม่เกี่ยวกับคดี'

บางคนอาจจะบอกว่า ขวดยาอาจจะถูกสลับตั้งแต่ก่อนจุนโกะตาย (สลับตั้งแต่วันที่จุนโกะไปหาโฮดากะ) ซึ่งก็เป็นไปไม่ได้อีกเช่นกัน เพราะในวันนั้นขวดยาอยู่ชั้นสอง และอยู่กับพวกมิวาโกะและโฮดากะตลอดเวลา

ดังนั้นเหลือตัวเลือกสองตัวก็คือ กล่องใส่ยา และกระเป๋าของมิวาโกะ ผมคิดว่าประเด็นน่าจะเป็นเรื่องของกล่องใส่ยามากกว่า แต่คำถามคือ ลายนิ้วมือใครล่ะ ที่ติดอยู่บนกล่องใส่ยา เป็นลายนิ้วมือของคนที่ไม่เกี่ยวข้องกับคดีด้วย แต่ไม่แปลกใจที่จะพบลายนิ้วมือนี้บนกล่องใส่ยา..

ความคิดแรกคือ ลายนิ้วมือของจุนโกะไง จุนโกะเข้ามาเอายาพิษใส่ในกล่องใส่ยา ก็ต้องเป็นลายนิ้วมือของจุนโกะสิ (ซึ่งคัมบายาชิอยู่ชั้นล่างในตอนนั้น ก็น่าจะเป็นคนฆ่าหรือเปล่านะ) แต่ถ้ามาคิดดีๆ เรื่องที่จุนโกะมาใส่ยาในกล่องใส่ยานี้ นักสืบคางะเฉลยไปตั้งแต่ช่วงคลี่คลายคดีรอบแรกแล้ว ดังนั้นไม่แปลกเลยที่จะมีลายนิ้วมือของจุนโกะอยู่ในกล่องใส่ยา

ถ้าเป็นแบบนั้นทำไมนักสืบคางะ ถึงพูดว่ามี 'ลายนิ้วมือของคนที่ไม่เกี่ยวข้องกับคดี' แทนที่จะพูดว่าเป็นลายนิ้วมือของจุนโกะ

สาเหตุก็เพราะลายนิ้วมือนั้นไม่ใช่ของจุนโกะ (มีประโยคนึงที่ระบุชัดเจนว่า ฝ่ายสืบสวนคิดว่าเป็นลายนิ้วมือของคนที่ไม่เกี่ยวข้องกับคดี ดังนั้นด้วยประโยคนี้เราตัดประเด็นลายนิ้วมือของจุนโกะทิ้งไปได้แน่นอน 100%)

คำถามคือถ้าไม่ใช่จุนโกะคือใคร ถ้าลายนิ้วมือนั้น
1. ไม่แปลกที่จะเจอบนกล่องใส่ยา
2. ไม่เกี่ยวกับคนที่อยู่ที่นั่นเลย

ถ้าเราไปย้อนอ่านตอนที่โฮดากะหยิบกล่องใส่ยามาครั้งแรก มีบทบรรยายไว้แล้วว่า กล่องใส่ยานั้น ภรรยาเก่า ซื้อมาให้ 'เป็นคู่' แปลว่า กล่องใส่ยานี้ มีสองอันที่หน้าตาเหมือนกันเปี๊ยบอยู่ และอีกอันก็น่าจะอยู่กับภรรยาเก่าของโฮดากะนั่นเอง

เป็นไปได้หรือไม่ว่า ฆาตกร จะมีโอกาสได้กล่องใส่ยาของภรรยาโฮดากะมาอยู่ในมือ ใส่ยาพิษเข้าไป แล้วสิ่งที่เค้าทำก็เพียงแค่สลับกล่องใส่ยา ในงานแต่ง (ซึ่งง่ายกว่าการเอายาพิษใส่กล่องเดิม)

ซึ่งพอคิดแบบนี้ มีเพียงคนเดียวที่จะมีโอกาสได้กล่องใส่ยาของภรรยาเก่าโฮดากะมาอยู่ในมือ นั่นก็คือ สีงุระ ผู้ช่วยของโฮดากะนั่นเอง เพราะในบทนึงเค้าบรรยายว่า ภรรยาเก่าของโฮดากะ ส่งของของเธอกลับมาคืนโฮดากะ และของพวกนั้นก็กองอยู่ในห้องของสีงุระ ที่ใช้เป็นออฟฟิศของโฮดากะโปรเจค

พอคิดแบบนี้ทุกอย่างก็ชัดเจน คือ สีงุระ ได้กล่องใส่ยาของภรรยาเก่ามาจากกองของที่ห้องตัวเอง กล่องใส่ยานั้นจึงมีลายนิ้วมือของภรรยาเก่าของโฮดากะอยู่

สึงุระเตรียมยาพิษเอาไว้ในกล่อง หาโอกาสที่จะสลับกล่องใส่ยานั้นในงาน
พอมีจังหวะที่ได้รับกล่องใส่ยามา เขาหย่อนกล่องใส่ยาใส่กระเป๋า พอบริกรเดินมา เขาก็เพียงแค่สลับเอากล่องใส่ยาพิษไปให้บริกร เพื่อเอาไปให้กับโฮดากะ

แน่นอนว่า เราไม่สามารถตัดประเด็นของบ.ก.ยูกิซาสะออกไปได้จากเหตุผลรายล้อม เธอก็ยังมีโอกาสเป็นฆาตกร
แต่ถ้าเราผูกเรื่องกับประเด็นที่นักสืบคางะระบุว่าลายนิ้วมือนี้เป็นจิ๊กซอว์ชิ้นสุดท้าย คำตอบจึงเหลือข้อเดียว คือคนที่จะได้ของของภรรยาเก่าของโฮดากะ มีเพียงซึงุระ ผู้ช่วยคนเดียวเท่านั้น

นี่คือมุมมองของผมนะครับ..

Nhà soạn kịch Hodaka Makoto bị đầu độc ngay tại đám cưới. Cuốn sách có ba phạm:
• Kanbayashi Takahiro, anh trai của cô dâu. Takahiro duy trì mối quan hệ loạn luân với em gái cũng là cô dâu, Miwako.
• Suruga Naoyuki, trợ lý của Makoto. Người luôn hận Makoto đã cướp đi người anh ta yêu.
• Yukizasa Kaori, người yêu cũ của Makoto, luôn hận Makoto đã chia tay cô ta mà cưới người khác.

Okay, thật ra mình không dự định đọc quyển này... bởi nó tương tự Ai đã giế cô ấy? (điều mình sẽ nói sau).
Xen kẽ nhau giữa ba góc nhìn của ba nghi pham. Lột tả các mối ác cảm của ba nghi phạm dành cho nạn nhân, nhưng có lẽ mình chỉ thích cảm xúc của Takahiro và nó khiến mình chạnh lòng - mình không có quyền phán xét gì tình cảm của anh ta cả, chỉ là cảm thấy nó thật buồn.



Còn diễn biến thì mình chỉ thấy nhàm chán... dù nhịp truyện nhanh nhưng nó cứ khiến mình không có hứng thú. Và tương tự như Tập 3 , cuốn sách này không tiết lộ hung thủ, mà người đọc phải tự đoán bằng manh mối tác giả để lại. Thú thật mình không phải người thích thể loại ""tương tác"" như này, thậm chí mình cũng không muốn biết hung thủ là ai :))) nên đọc xong mình cũng lười xem spoiler. Chủ yếu vì mình muốn đọc hết series về Thanh tra Kaga Kyoichiro nên phải đọc thôi.

แล้วเอาข้อมูลที่สืบมาได้ มาวางแผ่ไว้ตรงหน้า ให้คนอ่านตัดสินเอาเองว่า ""ใครคือฆาตกร""
มันโหดร้ายมากตรงที่ปกติ ""Keigo"" จะไม่เหลือข้อสงสัยที่เป็นตะกอนรอวันฟุ้งไว้ในใจคนอ่าน
แต่รอบนี้ไม่ใช่อย่างนั้น เพราะคำเฉลยที่คนอ่านวิเคราะห์เอง คิดเอง แล้วพึงพอใจในคำตอบของตัวเองมันเป็นเหมือนตะกอนจมอยู้ก้นแก้ว

review_2818253111,Ning Tsui,"May 12, 2019","看书一时爽，推理火葬场。
这本书对于只是想看故事最后有个结局的读者来说，体验可能是一到两颗星，因为最终凶手没通过作者的口说出来；但对于喜欢推理的人来说，是一个目前没有正确答案的问卷，希望在有生之年能看到答案。

以下是我对线索的整理及推理，涉嫌剧透，谨慎下拉。
推理请直接拉到第6点。

1.推理的基础是前女友准子，猫和穗和都是服用了准子改装的药而死（硝酸士的宁）。相关涉案人士已全部在书中出场，不涉及隐藏人物。以及开放式结局不是因为作者写崩了写不出结局。


2.整理一下毒药丸的去向。
一瓶鼻炎药有12粒，改装失败了一粒，准子服用了一粒，一共剩10粒。
【2粒】 — 准子潜入穗和家，放入药盒 — 穗和丢了 — 哥哥神林捡起 — 1粒喂猫测试药效 — ｛结果｝神林手上持有一颗
【8粒】— 处理尸体的时候带回了准子家 — 雪笹偷一颗 — 骏河偷一颗 — 骏河匿名威胁神林投毒，药丸转到神林手上 — ｛结果｝雪笹有一粒，神林有一粒（即神林手头共两颗）
此处留意的是到底最后准子家剩多少颗药丸。
雪笹第一次描述（第三章）是“桌上散落两个打开的空胶囊，瓶子倒出8粒”，第一次对质（倒数第四章）加贺也同意这种说法并确认瓶里共八颗，最后一章加贺突然说是加上散落的才6粒（第六章加贺说的是房间最终剩下6粒），雪笹偷完剩6粒，我觉得是加贺脑子瓦特了或者随后有人在他们离场后又偷了一粒。
所以出现了支线，到底最终准子家剩多少颗药丸。雪笹和骏河是不可能对药的颗数撒谎的，因为两人的证词相互印证，要不就是加贺说谎，要不就是后续有人再去偷了。


3.交药。
根据2，目前毒药的分布是 ：
【1粒】组装失败，【1粒】准子吃了，【1粒】神林喂猫，【1粒】穗和吃了，【1粒】雪笹交出，【1粒】神林交出。
如果按雪笹的说法准子房间瓶子最后剩6粒药的话，药齐了，那穗和吃的就是神林手上的其中一颗（喂猫剩的或骏河给的）。
如果按加贺抽风的说法还少了一颗，那就先让神林把手头另一颗交出来，再跟另一个人对质。（按丢药顺序，另一个人肯定不是准子）


4.加贺终章说法划重点。
a.美和子的包，药瓶和小药盒上有不明指纹。
b.指纹不是在场的人或穗和的。
c.指纹是本应留下痕迹的人的指纹。
d.听懂这番话的人是凶手。
我分析本应留下指纹痕迹又不在现场的，有三个人，准子、西和绘里和侍应生。准子拿过药盒，西和绘里拿过包，传过药盒，有可能碰过药瓶。侍应生传过药盒。
不明指纹能让人起疑，我觉得应该是在不合理的地方，比如药盒或药瓶内部，比如侍应生的指纹留在了药盒内，再比如说美和子药瓶上有准子的指纹（？！），再比如说准子的药瓶上有西和的指纹（？！）。


5.小细节。
a.准子在药盒里放了两粒药。
b.穗和在家时让美和子婚礼前备2粒药（第二章）。
c.穗和交给美和子的药瓶里有10粒药，骏河交给服务生时药盒有一颗药。
d.死后穗和药瓶里剩9粒药，都没有毒（倒数第八章）。


6.我的推理。
做过很多假设，最后觉得这个更符合上面的细节，所以最终给出的是下面这个推理。

【凶手是在场的所有嫌疑人，美和子不知情。】

雪笹想让美和子有更多的灵感，嫁给一个烂人跟新郎戏剧性的在婚礼上死亡，后者更有利于创作，也更能保护美和子。
骏河想帮准子复仇，另外穗和的公司已每况愈下，如果能和雪笹联手，美和子会是新的摇钱树。
神林想保护妹妹，或者说想妹妹继续留在身边。
过程应该是这样，在处理完准子尸体后，雪笹发现骏河偷药，二人坦白联手。然后找到神林商量对策（婚礼前一天晚上，美和在在美容院，神林闲逛）。然后三人定下计策，用准子的毒药瓶换掉美和子手头的药瓶。三人此时手头一共有4粒药，加上准子家里的6粒，一共有10粒，跟美和子手上药瓶的药丸数量一致。但他们需要试药效，因此神林毒杀流浪猫，剩9粒毒药。
准子、雪笹、骏河、美和子都知道穗和觉得药效不够，需要备2颗药，而穗和不愿在婚礼上鼻炎发作，应该是准备直接吃两颗药维持药效。他们把1粒无毒的药与9粒毒药混在一起替换原有的药，当晚神林与美和子在咖啡厅碰头后替换掉（即此时美和子手上的是准子的药瓶，因为加1粒无毒的比换9粒有毒的要快）。

【由于穗和会吃两颗药，因此必然会吃到一颗毒药。】

然后婚礼当天，雪笹和骏河都特意没碰药盒，但骏河发现药盒里只有一颗药，为了确保穗和能吃下毒药，他们需要拿回美和子处的毒药，加到药盒里变成2粒。而药盒里只有一粒药的原因是，药不是美和子放的，可能是由伴娘或西和绘里放的，他们不知道穗和的习惯。
于是雪笹回收美和子手上的毒药瓶，换回原来的药瓶，然后找西和/侍应生在毒药瓶中取一颗加进药盒；或是在发现后及时让西和加药，后续回收毒药瓶。此时毒药瓶中共8粒药（1正常7毒，或8毒），美和子手头的药瓶也是9粒真药（换药时被抽出一粒加进毒药瓶或回收毒药瓶时处理掉一粒）。
穗和死后，神林、雪笹分别从毒药瓶里取出一颗药恢复计划中自己手头药的数量，此时药瓶里剩（1正常5毒，或6毒）。雪笹和骏河见面，还毒药瓶。骏河把毒药瓶擦掉指纹后印上准子指纹，归位。但药瓶内的西和（大概率）/侍应生指纹并未擦掉。【对应了最后加贺说的不明身份但又应该出现的指纹，加贺说的药瓶应该是准子的药瓶，穗和的药瓶上西和或侍应生都不算不明身份。但他们的指纹如果出现在准子的药瓶上，就算不明身份，但考虑到这曾经被换成了美和子手上的药瓶，这个指纹的出现是应该的。】
最后骏河让警察发现准子的尸体。
此时，由于无法辨别毒药与普通药的区别，他们无法判别准子药瓶里剩下的有没有正常药丸，因此无法回收真药。根据加贺描述的矛盾，现场有7粒药丸和6粒药丸，我认为他的意思是有7粒形式上的药丸，但只有6粒有毒。他应该是以此为契机发现这手法的。
综上，我的推理是接近全员恶人。除了最后几章，前面的个人叙述应该都有个人修饰部分（参见《恶意》），只能说他们都杀了穗和，“美和子的未来”成为了推动这个局的大部分原因。
然而最后美和子的崩溃也是…我觉得她以此为契机后续会成为很有传奇色彩的作家吧，毕竟像她哥说的她一直在演戏。细思极恐的是如果美和子不像表面上看上去那么单纯，那可能整件事都是她策划的，她需要一个传奇的背景、需要摆脱哥哥，于是看透了这几个人性格的她选择以嫁给穗和的方式策划了一起谋杀。本来可能是借准子之手做成殉情的局（通知准子说穗和要结婚），现在计划有变但结局还是达到了期望。

以上。


PS 神林当科学家的我觉得也没那么傻，9颗有毒药丸均匀分成10颗也可以呀（好吧他的时间可能不够）。如果能成功分装，那就除非警方验总药量判定大概几粒药丸了。


PPS 感谢看到这里忍受我絮絮叨叨推理完的人，过几年说不定我再翻起这本书推理思路又变了也未可言之。但目前我自己分析的结局中我觉得可能性比较大的是这个手法。",5,1 like,57

ก่อนอื่นต้องยอมรับก่อนเลยว่าอ่านจบแล้วถึงกับต้องอุทานออกมาดังๆว่า เ-ี้ยอะไรวะเนี่ย จบแบบนี้จริงๆเหรอ อุตส่าห์อ่านมาตั้งนาน แต่บอกแบบนี้ไม่ใช่หนังสือห่วยนะ แต่เป็นกลวิธีในการเล่าเรื่องที่เคโงะใช้การเล่าผ่านตัวละครหลัก 3 คนที่มีแรงจูงใจในการฆาตกรรมคือ คัมบายาชิ ทาคาฮิโระ พี่ชายของมิวาโกะ เจ้าสาว, ยูกิซาสะ คาโอริ บรรณาธิการของมิวาโกะที่เป็นคนแนะนำให้รู้จักกับมาโกโตะ และสึรุนะ นาโอยูกิ เพื่อนร่วมงานและลูกน้องในบริษัทของมาโกโตะ ซึ่งการเล่าเรื่องผ่านตัวละครทั้ง 3 คนสลับกันไปมาเป็นตัวดำเนินเรื่องให้เดินไปข้างหน้าพร้อมๆกับการเฉลยปมและแรงจูงใจที่เป็นเหตุผลให้ต้องการฆ่ามาโกโตะ แต่ยิ่งเรื่องราวผ่านไปแต่ละหน้าก็ยิ่งสับสนว่าสรุปแล้วใครเป็นฆาตกรกันล่ะเนี่ย แล้วยิ่งมาพีคเอาในช่วงท้ายอีกว่าทั้ง 3 คนต่างเผยไต๋ในการฆาตกรรมมาโกโตะออกมาแต่สุดท้ายไต๋ที่ทั้ง 3 คนเผยออกมากลับไม่ใช่สาเหตุที่มาโกโตะถูกฆ่าตาย แล้วสรุปใครล่ะเป็นฆาตกรแล้วฆ่ามาโกโตะด้วยสาเหตุอะไร ฆ่าด้วยวิธีไหน??? โอ๊ย!!! ยิ่งอ่านยิ่งงง 555

สรุปเป็นอีกหนึ่งผลงานของเคโงะที่ใช้เทคนิคในการเล่าเรื่องแพรวพราว(แต่ยังไม่ประทับใจเท่าปาฏิหาริย์ร้านชำนามิยะ) ใช้ฉากการสรุปเรื่องราวเหมือนนิยายของอกาธา คริสตี้ ที่ให้ผู้ต้องสงสัยทั้งหมดรวมทั้งนักสืบมารวมตัวกันอยู่ในห้องเดียวกันเพื่อชี้แจงถึงแรงจูงใจและการสืบสวนเพื่อเฉลยตัวฆาตกร??? ใครอยากอ่านนิยายสืบสวนสอบสวนที่จบแบบทำเอาอึ้ง ต้องมานั่งวนเวียนคิดแล้วคิดอีกว่าสุดท้ายใครเป็นฆาตกรกันล่ะเนี่ยก็ไม่สมควรพลาดด้วยประการทั้งปวง",4,1 like,57
review_1644600948,Buchdoktor,"May 21, 2016","Am Tag der Hochzeit der erfolgreichen Lyrikerin Miwako Kanbayashi mit Hodaka Makoto stirbt der Bräutigam überraschend. Im Zusammenhang damit kommt es zu einem weiteren Todesfall, der als Selbstmord inszeniert sein könnte. Drei Verdächtige äußern sich in Ichform abwechselnd zu den Ereignissen und ihren gegenseitigen Beziehungen: Suruga, der Manager Makotos, der Bruder Takahiro der Braut und die Lektorin der Braut. Jeder von ihnen verfolgte handfeste eigene Interessen und hatte zu der geplanten Hochzeit eigenwillige Ansichten. Weitere Personen tauchen auf. Zu klären ist, wer Mittel, Motiv und zur Tatzeit Gelegenheit zur Tat an dem Drehbuchautor hatte. Auch wenn die drei Berichterstatter anscheinend den exakten Verlauf wiedergeben, muss man als Leser damit rechnen, dass sie gerissen taktieren, dass man selbst etwas übersieht oder dass am Ende keiner der Verdächtigen überführt werden kann. Höchst interessant sind dabei die Emotionen, die die Berichterstatter bei anderen Figuren wahrnehmen und was sie damit über sich selbst preisgeben. Offen werden zunächst keine Emotionen gezeigt, was in Zusammenhang mit einer geplanten Hochzeit zu einer eigenartig unterkühlten Atmosphäre führt. Miwako und ihr Bruder waren Waisen, die nach den Tod der Eltern getrennt wurden und sich erst als Erwachsene wiederfanden. Auch andere Figuren kennen sich von früher; Beschützerinstinkte, Konkurrenz um handfeste materielle Werte und Erpressung sind zu verzeichnen. Schließlich betritt wie mit einem Tusch der scharfsinnige Kommissar Kaga diese Bühne streng verborgener Emotionen. Er vermittelt mit beeindruckender Selbstgewissheit den Eindruck, dass er diesen Zeugen gewachsen ist und den Täter überführen wird. Taga will vermutlich mit seinem Auftritt das schwächste Glied in der Kette verunsichern und so erreichen, dass durch bröckelnde Loyalität diese Person, selbst wenn sie unschuldig wäre, dennoch den Täter zu einem Geständnis veranlassen wird. Das Ende ist ungewöhnlich – und tatsächlich hat Kaga ein Indiz parat, das ich auch bei höchster Aufmerksamkeit beim Lesen übersehen hatte.

Wer sich - trotz des unpassenden Klappentexts - vorstellen kann, den Roman noch einmal von vorn zu beginnen und das entscheidende Indiz nun mit anderen Augen zu sehen, findet einen äußerst raffinierten Krimi, bei dem mich besonders die verborgenen Gefühle der Figuren fasziniert haben.

Kurz vor ihrer Hochzeit treffen sich Bräutigam, Braut und einige Freunde. Makoto ist ein bekannter Drehbuchautor und seine Verlobte Miwako hat einige Lyrikbände veröffentlicht, wobei ihr Glanz den Makotos überstrahlt. Allerdings hält Miwakos Bruder nicht viel von der Beziehung. Außer Miwako scheint niemand so richtig traurig zu sein als Makoto auf dem Weg zum Altar zusammenbricht und stirbt. Kurz nach dem tragischen Ereignis wird auch eine ehemalige Freundin des Autors tot aufgefunden. Was kann zu den beiden Todesfällen geführt haben? Kommissar Kaga beginnt mit seiner Untersuchung.

Aus der Sicht von Miwakos Bruder, der Lektorin und des Managers des Toten werden die Ereignisse geschildert. Allein schon dies macht den Roman von Keigo Higashino zu etwas besonderem. In einem Moment behaupten alle drei, sie hätten Makoto getötet, eine Lösung also, die keine ist. Und so ist es an Kommissar Kaga, die Geschehnisse und die verschiedenen Aussagen der Beteiligten aufzudröseln und den Täter zu ermitteln oder auch die auszuschließen, die für die Tat nicht in Frage kommen. Dabei stellt sich heraus, dass Makoto ein rechter Unsympath war, der seine jeweiligen Freundinnen ziemlich mies behandelte und entsorgte, wenn er ihm in den Kram passte. Man fragt sich, wieso er nun die zarte Miwako heiraten will. Geht es ihm mehr um das Ausnutzen ihres Potentials als Autorin? Die Schaffenskraft des Makoto scheint ihren Zenit überschritten zu haben.

Gespannt verfolgt man die Geschehnisse und versucht hinter das Rätsel zu kommen, wer hier was zu verbergen hat. Gerade wenn man glaubt, die Motive des vermeintlichen Täters entschlüsselt zu haben, ergibt sich wieder eine andere Wendung, die einen alles in Zweifel ziehen lässt. Und einen besonderen Kniff lässt sich der Autor schließlich einfallen, der das Ermittlerherz im Leser höher schlagen lässt, man wünscht sich, die Zeit würde ausreichen, das Buch ein zweites Mal zu lesen, um wirklich jede Einzelheit zu würdigen. Hat man die Gelegenheit, den Roman als ebook zur Verfügung zu haben, kann man auch den Nutzen einiger Links zu genießen. Eine kleine Narretei des Autors macht diesen klassischen Krimi mit liebevollen Reminiszenzen an Agatha Christie zu einer Spezialität des Genres.",4,0 likes,57
review_4048972851,too lazy to read,"Oct 04, 2021","** spoiler alert ** เล่มนี้ให้ 4.9 ไปเรยยย ชอบกว่า ใครฆ่าเธอ อีกกก (ที่หักคะแนนไปนิดนึงก็คือจากตอนจบนั่นแหละที่บอกดี ๆ ไม่ได้หรอ5555)

สำหรับเล่มนี้ ซึ่งที่ประทับใจอย่างแรกเลย ก็คือการเล่าเรื่องจากมุมมองตัวละครสามตัวสลับกันไป ทำให้เราได้เหมือนลองเป็นเขา ลองอยู่ในคสามคิดเขา ซึ่งมีส่วนมากๆ ที่ทำให้การค่อย ๆ แอบใบ้เป็นไปอย่่งสมูธขึ้นมาก แต่เอาจริงตอนอ่านจบก็ยังแอบเหวออะว่าใครทำ55555555 แต่ต้องขอบคุณผู้แปลกับชาวเน็ตที่วิเคราะห์กันจนทำให้เราพอกระจ่าง ซึ่งความเห็นส่วนใหญ่มุ่งไปที่เจ้าสาวกับเพื่อนเจ้าบ่าว พร้อมกับบทวิเคราะห์สนับสนุนแบบแน่นสุด ๆ

ส่วนตัวแล้วตอนแรกเราก็คิดว่าหรือจะเป็นเจ้าสาว (ตอนที่พี่ชายเจ้าสาวมีบทพูดขึ้นมาว่าเธอกำลังสวมบทบาทคนสูญเสียว่าที่เจ้าบ่าว) แต่ก็ตัดออกอยู่ดีจากโดยรวมของการดำเนินเรื่อง แล้วก็รู้สึกว่าแรงจูงใจแทบไม่มีเลย ก็คือสรุปเราคิดว่าเพื่อนเจ้าบ่าวเป็นคนฆ่า เหตุผลคือแรงจูงใจเกินร้อย พยายามใช้พี่ชายเจ้าสาวฆ่าแล้วด้วยการส่งจดหมายขู่ แอบเอายาไปหลายเม็ดสุด มีของจากภรรยาเก่าของผู้ตายส่งมาให้ที่ออฟฟิศ (ซึ่งรวมถึงกล่องใส่ยาที่ผู้ตายกับภรรยาเก่าซื้อมากันเป็นคู่ด้วย) สมมุติฐานที่ว่า ลุงคนนนี้จะสลับแค่กล่องใส่ยาตอนส่งกล่องยาให้บ๋อยโรงแรมคือดูเป็นไปได้มาก เพราะมันง่าย และก็แทบไม่เสี่ยงอะไรเลย

อีกอย่างที่ชอบเกี่ยวกับเล่มนี้คือมีความดราม่าใส่ลงไป ตัวละครมีปมในตัวเองที่ซ่อนอยู่กันทั้งนั้นโดยที่ตัสละครอื่นไม่รู้ (แต่เรารู้ไง มันเลยลุ้น แล้วก็แบบโฮะ ๆ ฉันรู้น่าาา ซึ่งปมเหล่านี้จะดูธรรมดาไปเลย ถ้าเคโงะไม่ได้เลือกที่จะเล่าเรื่องผ่านมัมมองสามคนสลับกันไป)

สุดท้ายนี อยากบอกว่าเคโงะเนี่ยแหละสุดยอดนักสืบ นักวางแผน ยิ่งอ่านหนังสือเขาคือยิ่งโดนตกขึ้นทุกเล่ม แล้วแต่ละเล่มก็คือหยิบจับอะไรมาแบบสุดอะ ไม่รู้จะชมยังไง ในเล่มนี้ ระหว่างอ่านไปก็แบบอุทาน ห้ะ! อมก! กับความฉลาดของตำรวจคางะสุดเท่ออกมาเกินสิบรอบอะจากการวิเคราะห์ สืบสวนสถานการณ์แล้วก็ตัวละคร (ซึ่งก็สร้างสรรค์ออกมาโดยเคโงะเลยอยากชมไปหมด)",5,0 likes,57
review_3852896977,Fene,"Feb 24, 2021","--//一個人究竟活成什麼樣子，才會讓身邊的每個人都想殺了他?//

這是加賀系列的第5部作品，《我殺了他》和第三部的《誰殺了她》除了同樣是以加賀探案為主線外，基本上沒有任何關係。
東野圭吾說:"" 《我殺了他》延續了《誰殺了她》的模式，只是這次嫌疑人增加到了三個。有關本書的推理論戰愈演愈烈，身為作者，我真的很高興。""

誠是一個死了也活該的人。
突然前來的前女友被誠拒見後，她穿著白裙戴上白紗手握花束在他的院子裡自殺。為了讓婚禮能夠順利進行，他冷漠的逼著助手幫他把屍體搬回前女友的家裡，他不希望自己和她的死扯上任何關係。然而，婚禮進行當天，該死的誠在步入教堂時突然倒地身亡。他身邊的人都暗自慶幸，誠終於死了，大家的心中是前所未有的暢快。但是，在前女友的屍體被發現後，加賀認為兩起案件別有蹊蹺。三名嫌疑人中，一位是自己喜歡的女人遭玩弄後含恨自殺，一位是被拋棄的舊情人，另一位則是愛妹心切的哥哥，三人都有動機，也曾參與殺人的行動，但是，究竟是誰、因為什麼、怎樣殺了誠?

加賀心思細膩從容不迫，不放過任何一處蛛絲馬跡，對所有的疑點和線索追查到底。他有能力看清說謊者的本質，說出既能讓所有人信服又能讓兇手坦白罪狀的推理。這本書藉由三名嫌疑人的角度，交叉陳述整個故事，不但可以了解每個嫌疑人的想法，更可以從他們的觀點去揣摩另外兩人的心思。我特別喜歡結尾的部分，三位原本對誠的死感到毫不愧疚的嫌疑人，在面對加賀時，卻紛紛掏出了對自己有利的物證，搞笑。

和《誰殺了她》一樣，同樣沒有點名兇手，最後只有加賀的一句""兇手就是你""作為結尾。面對這種結局始終會心有不甘，經過反復推敲、重新翻閱書裡隱藏的細枝末節，當加賀點出的細節在腦子裡一閃而過時，我拿起紙筆自己做了一番推理，恍然大悟之際害我起了一身雞皮，這個故事的鋪陳和架構實在太震撼了。
所以啊，讀東野的書，想偷懶一點都不行，懶了讀了你只會對這本帶有開放式結局的書感到一頭霧水。

不管對與否，我很享受解謎的過程，而且我對自己的猜測甚是滿意。抑或引用早前康正所說的，只要知道這三個人中，其中一個是兇手就足夠了。",4,0 likes,57

review_4284083608,Chalida Cheeptumrong,"Oct 13, 2021","อย่างแรกที่อยากจะบอกคือรำคาญสำนวนการแปลในบางช่วงมากๆ
การละประธาน การไม่เชื่อมประโยค มันทำให้อ่านสะดุดซ้ำๆ
อันที่จริงนักเขียนนิยายไทยบางท่านก็ใช้สำนวนทำนองนี้ แต่นี่มันนิยายแปลไง
มันอ่านยากค่ะ มันถี่ไป มันไม่จำเป็นมั้ยล่ะ?
หลายๆ ประโยคก็เหมือนยังติดไวยากรณ์ฉบับภาษาญี่ปุ่น คำนามบางคำก็เข้าใจยาก
เราไม่โทษคนแปลหรอก แต่คนตรวจงานก็ควรจะแก้ไขให้มันสมูทไม่ใช่เหรอ?
นี่ยังไม่นับพวกเว้นวรรคแปลกๆ อีกนะ

ส่วนเนื้อหาในเล่มนี้เราว่าเฉยๆ และยืดยาวมาก
แม้จะไม่ถึงขั้นน่าเบื่อแต่มันน่าเบื่อก็ตรงที่ต้องกลับไปอ่านประโยคเดิมหรือคำบางคำซ้ำหลายๆ รอบ
บวกกับช่วงหลังๆ ที่มีความน่ารำคาญของมิวาโกะ(น้องสาว) มาสร้างความหงุดหงิดเรื่อยๆ
เราว่าบทสรุปชีวิตของน้องสาวคนนี้ยังน่าสนใจมากกว่าใครเป็นคนร้ายเสียอีก
แน่นอนว่าไม่มีจย้าาา ปลายเปิดไปอีกจย้าาาา

::สปอยล์คนร้าย::
อันที่จริงฉบับภาษาญี่ปุ่นเขามีหน้าแถมแบบปิดผนึกมาให้ในท้ายเล่มด้วย
เราไม่แน่ใจว่าเนื้อหาในนั้นเขียนอะไรบ้างแต่เท่าที่ไปอ่านในเพจสปอยล์ของคนญี่ปุ่นเขาเขียนว่า

""ピルケースは同じものが2つあること
ตลับใส่ยามีเหมือนกัน 2 อัน
ピルケースは前妻とお揃いであったこと
ตลับใส่ยานั้นเป็นของเข้าคู่กันกับภรรยาเก่า
離婚して前妻との思い出の品は送り返されていること。
ข้าวของที่มีความทรงจำร่วมกันกับภรรยาที่หย่าร้ากันไปแล้วได้ถูกส่งกลับคืนมา
犯行に使用されたピルケースには前妻の指紋がついていること
ตลับใส่ยาที่ถูกใช้งานในคดีมีรอยนิ้วมือของภรรยาเก่าติดอยู่""
*https://oreb-z.com/2020/09/22/watashi...

ถ้าจะเป็นคนร้ายได้ก็ต้องรู้ถึงการมีอยู่ของตลับยาที่ว่าและยังต้องมีมันไว้ในครอบครอง
ซึ่งคนร้ายก็คือ ""สึรุงะ นาโอยูกิ"" นั่นเอง

จังหวะที่สับเปลี่ยนตลับยาคือหน้าที่ 122 ค่ะ

หนังสือนิยายสืบสวนสอบสวนฝีมือมหาเทพเคโงะ ที่เขียนออกมาเทไปทางรวมเรื่องสั้นสไตล์ cozy suspense ขนาดกระทัดรัดเล่มนี้ อ่านแล้วให้อารมณ์ยิ้มมุมปาก แบบรวดเดียวจบ

เคโงะแนะนำตัวละครใหม่ (ไม่รู้ว่าจะเป็นซีรีย์ใหม่รึเปล่า) สองคนคือสองสาวคู่หูแอร์โฮสเตส “เอโกะและบีโกะ” ซึ่งผมว่ามันออกมาสอดคล้องกับแนวคู่หูดาราตลกที่คนญี่ปุ่นมักจะคุ้นเคย นั่นคือมีสองคน แต่ละคนมี character ต่างกัน แต่อยู่ด้วยกันแล้วมันเหมาะเจาะ ผสมกลมกลืน

สองสาวเอโกะบีโกะก็เป็นเช่นนั้น
เอโกะ สวยสมาร์ท คิดวิเคราะห์แบบมีลำดับเป็นขั้นเป็นตอน
ส่วนบีโกะอารมณ์แบบสาวฮามุ้งมิ้ง แต่เป็นพวกช่างเอ๊ะ ช่างสังเกต
ซึ่งทั้งคู่เป็นคู่หูแอร์โฮสเตสที่มักมี flight คู่กัน

เรื่องสั้นแต่ละเรื่องจะเปิดด้วยเหตุฆาตกรรมหรือเรื่องลึกลับบางอย่าง แล้วอาศัยความเป็นนักสืบจำเป็นของสองสาวมาช่วยคลี่คลาย
ต้องบอกเลยว่าทั้งๆ ที่มีคนตาย แต่ไม่มีความอี๋แหวะหรือฉากฆาตกรรมสุดสยองออกมาแม้แต่น้อย
ความเครียดมันถูกกลบด้วยความฮาและความดราม่าของสาวบีโกะ
นอกจากนี้ยังมีรายละเอียดปลีกย่อยบางอย่างของชีวิตแอร์โฮสเตสให้อ่านเพลินๆ เปิดโลกทัศน์ ซึ่งบางเรื่องบางอย่างมันก็คนละ culture กับบ้านเรา

อ่านได้เพลิดเพลิน รวดเดียวจบ

review_3450390168,Carson,"Jul 19, 2020","This is my second Keigo Higashino book and I’m starting to think I may not like him as an author.
This book lacks a sense of purpose. I criticized Parallel World Love Story for having unengaging characters and an anticlimactic finish and this book is like six different short stories that are all exactly that.
We have our two recurring lead characters A-ko and B-ko who have fine chemistry and started out somewhat interesting but aren’t engaging enough to carry the story on their own and never get any development to change that. Higashino loves to write about how fat, dumb, and annoying B-ko is while A-ko happens to be the genius who solves the puzzle each time yet manages to simultaneously be the blandest character, probably because the solutions to the mysteries are just as mundane as she is.
A few of the mysteries have at least serviceable set ups and by far the best section of the book is the first 30 pages which set up a murder mystery I thought the entire book might cover, but each one ends in the most boring way possible and halfway in you realize this is a pattern that isn’t going to change.
I don’t know what the point of this book was meant to be. There’s not much else to say about it. It’s a waste of time and you shouldn’t read it. I happen to have two other Higashino books which I am beginning to groan at the prospect of reading; hopefully they’re better than this one. They’d better be.",1,1 like,59

หนังสือจะแบ่งออกเป็นเคส ๆ ไป ประมาณว่าเล่าถึงเหตุการณ์ที่สองสาวเจอเป็นตอน ๆ

ทนอ่านแล้วแต่ไม่ไหวจริง ๆ ขอลาหลังอ่านได้ 4 เคสค่ะ ห่วยมาก
ทำไมถึงห่วย? เราจะมาแบ่งสิ่งที่เราคิดว่าห่วยของแต่ละเคสดังนี้ค่ะ

เคสที่ 1 - คดีฆาตกรรมในโรงแรม
1. B โกะ เป็นตัวละครที่หยาบคายแบบ.. เพื่ออะไร? ไม่เข้าใจว่าทำไมต้องใส่ความหยาบคายมาให้ตัวละครนี้ มันมาเสริมอะไรในเรื่อง? ส่วนตัวอ่านแล้วงงมาก จู่ ๆ ก็กราดใส่คู่สนทนาแบบสับ
2. การแสดงออกของตัวละครหลักหลังรู้ว่ามีเหตุฆาตกรรมเกิดขึ้นแบบใกล้ตัวสุด ๆ นั้น โคตรจะไม่สมเหตุสมผล ไม่ realistic สุด ๆ ยังคุยเล่นกันได้แบบงงๆ
2. เนื้อเรื่อง Cliche มาก ไม่น่าสนใจ ไม่ว้าว ไม่อะไรทั้งนั้น

เคสที่ 2 - คณะเบบี้ทัวร์
1. B โกะเจ้าเก่าเจ้าเดิม หยาบคายใส่แม่เด็กแบบโอเว่อร์มาก อยากจะให้ตัวละครดูเฟียสแต่ดูสะเหล่อแทน
2. เท่าที่รู้สองสาวเป็นแอร์ ไม่ใช่ตำรวจ แล้วทำไมถึงไปสอบสวนเหตุการณ์กับพนักงานที่ทำงานกับคณะทัวร์ได้ขนาดนั้น นึกว่าตำรวจสอบปากคำพยาน
3. แม่เด็กที่มาเคลมว่าเป็นลูกตัวเอง ในเรื่องไม่มีตรงไหนที่ตรวจสอบเลยนะว่าเป็นแม่เด็กจริง ๆ หรือเปล่า ขาดรายละเอียดสุด
4. แรงจูงใจของคนก่อเรื่องคือตลกมาก
5. ซีนจบนี่หมดคำจะพูด ตลกค่ะ มันไม่เฟียสไม่สะใจไม่อะไรเลย ขายขำ

เคสที่ 3 - หนุ่มหล่อบนเครื่อง
1. ผู้ชายมีเบอร์บ้านได้ยังไง?
- เนื้อเรื่อง ผ่านอยู่ ดีกว่าเรื่องที่ผ่าน ๆ มา -

เคสที่ 4 - คดีลุงเจ้าของร้านขนม
1. B โกะ again, ประสาทเหมือนเดิม
2. ตำรวจวนเวียนอยู่กับข้อสงสัยที่ว่าผู้หญิงที่ตายเป็นชู้กับลุงนานมาก ทั้งที่มีพยานที่สามารถปัดตกข้อสงสัยนั้นได้ไปแล้ว ก็ยังพูดวนอยู่ (ผู้หญิงแค่บังเอิญไปเจอลุงที่โรงแรม อิงจากคำให้การณ์ของตัวละครหลักเองเลย)
3. Again, สองสาว with the unrealistic reaction to murders
4. ตอนจบคืออุทานกับตัวเองว่า what the actual fuck จบแบบกะหลั่วสุด คือมีผู้หญิงบริสุทธิ์ต้องตายเพราะแผนการกู้ร้านขนมสั่ว ๆ ของป้ากับลุงนั่นเลยนะ มันน่ายกย่องตรงไหน แล้วที่สำคัญคือ มันเป็นเหตุผลที่มีน้ำหนักพอให้ ปล่อย ผ่าน ตรง ไหน!!

หลังจากอ่านเรื่องที่ 4 จบ แม้แต่จะอ่านต่อเพื่อมาเขียนรีวิวก็ไม่ไหวแล้ว ขอบาย ให้ 2 คะแนนที่ปกสวย, เกริ่นตัวละครมาน่าสนใจ + เขียนเล่าเรื่องได้ดีอยู่พอ ไปอ่านจริง ๆ ตัวละครคืออะไรไม่รู้ ไม่ใกล้เคียงที่จินตนาการณ์ไว้ว่าจะได้อ่านบทสองแอร์สาวเท่ ๆ solving cases แบบฉลาด ๆ เลย",2,0 likes,59

review_3098726231,Cathy,"Jan 06, 2020",跟作者的其他成名作不是同一個風格，也不是同一個level :P 兩個個性塑造比較扁平的空姐主角，作為偵探搭檔，推理一些跟班機飛航有關的瑣事。有一些瑣事有涉及到殺人事件，但是基本上都算是比較溫和的瑣事，然後這些瑣事會有點謎題讓偵探搭檔去解答。故事也許是想走喜劇風格，但是好像搞笑得比較刻意，沒有非常好笑。謎題解開了之後，會有一點恍然大悟的感覺，但是給讀者的印象不會很深刻。,3,0 likes,59
review_3447110289,Ng Yan Kiu Chiemi,"Jul 16, 2020",這本《空中殺人現場》是繼《第十年的情人節》東野圭吾的另一佳作，當時我閲讀完《第十年的情人節》，見東野圭吾又有新作品，便立刻買回家。這本書比《第十年的情人節》更溫馨、幽默風趣和活潑十足，但結局仍是十分轉折，帶給讀者驚喜。這本書的主角—早瀨英子和蕂眞美子是新日本航空的招牌空中服務員，她們雖然外貌和性格都截然不同，但卻是新密的朋友、室友兼搭擋，原本平平無其的飛機，卻發生一連串的殺人事件，閲讀其間會令讀者猶如置身其中一樣，跟主角們一起尋找真相！,5,0 likes,59

Các vụ tự sát và giết người liên tục xảy ra tại ngôi biệt thự thập tự của gia tộc Takemiya. Tại ngôi biệt thự, có sự xuất hiện có một con búp bê chú hề hay ""búp bê bi kịch"" - được cho là đã giáng tai ương xuống gia tộc Takemiya.

Điểm khiến cho cuốn sách này mới mẻ: có một vài đoạn được kể dưới góc nhìn của con búp bê chú hề, nghe khá thú vị, nhưng mình không hẳn thích (dù nó được dùng để đánh lừa người đọc).

Mình không cảm nổi và hiểu được mối quan hệ giữa các nhân vật này (đặc biệt là chuyện tình cảm), có gì khác ngoài các cuộc đối thoại liên tục, và việc các nhân vật này ghét nạn nhân không? Nhân vật chính mờ nhạt, nhân vật khác xuất hiện thì ảo.

Mình bất ngờ về thủ pháp ở phần cuối. Phần cuối có một tiết lộ khiến mình liên tưởng đến Conan :))",2,10 likes,62
review_2326205451,Eileen Wan,"Mar 13, 2018","在綿綿細雨，天色灰暗的日子最適合讀的就是本格派的推理小說—在位於市郊的十字屋大宅裡發生連環兇手案，兇手究竟是大家族裡面的一人還是那個傳說會帶來不幸的小丑人偶呢？

在《十字屋的小丑》裡面作者東野圭吾所用的橋段，詭計，甚至結局推理迷應該一點都不會陌生，甚至會比書中偵探更早還原事件的真相，然而基於對傳統本格推理的喜愛，我還是一直追看下去，而且還看得津津有味。

小說中的偵探是人偶師悟淨，書中記載了他曾解決過幾件不可思議的案件，很可惜作者只寫了一部有關他的小說。說起人偶師我就想起傀儡師左近，那真是一部不錯的推理漫畫，很懷念90年代末，千禧年初的推理作品（例如《Trick》）。近年來合心意的推理劇和小說越來越少，前陣子看電視劇《滅罪師》，它走的也是本格推理路線，不過我覺得這劇的詭計過於天馬行空（有像島田莊司的作品），太燒腦的劇集不是我喜歡的。再過些時日我想再回去翻讀松本清張的《點與線》，森村誠一的《人性的證明》，橫溝正史的《本陣殺人事件》，這些作品才是經典。",3,0 likes,62

review_1303913398,Mizuki,"Jun 09, 2015","I never like Keigo Higashino's novels despite he is a darling of the Japanese publishers and his books are selling like crazy in many Asian countries. Many people praised him as a master of detective novels, but I never think his books are really up there with the other grand masters from the past generations.

Let's get back to the actual novel in hand, shall we? First it's a traditional murder mystery: the family head of a rich family and his mistress were found dead in the family manor, police suspected it's a crime done by someone from within the family. There're mistrust and many family secrets among the family members blah blah blah.

Mr. Higashino hadn't made any mistake in this book, the story is fast paced and effectively written but the characters and their relationships with one another are a bit flat (but I can live with it). But does it mean the story is charming or refreshing when I say ""Mr. Higashino hadn't made any mistake""? No. There's nothing charming about the murder mystery and the characters, although the mystery is explained in a decent way, but in the end, it's a highly forgettable book.",3,,62

I almost wanted to give this book 3 stars due to the lack of depth in those stories, but the entertainment value is undeniably huge so I upgraded it into 3.8 stars.

PS: although it is still sad to know even in a country such as Japan, which is known for its strong publishing industry and a huge reading population, the selling rates are still going low and the publishers still need to struggle for survival.

ที่ว่าหนัก คือดราม่าความสัมพันธ์ และแรงจูงใจในการฆ่ามันหนักหนาสาหัส
ที่ว่าเหนื่อย คือเหนื่อยในรายละเอียดของ “ทริค” ที่ใช้ในการฆ่าที่มันสลับซับซ้อน

นิยายสืบสวนสอบสวนสัญชาติญี่ปุ่นฝีมือมหาเทพเคโงะ
จั่วหัวไว้ว่าเป็นเล่มแรกของซีรีย์ตำรวจสุดเทพ “คางะ” เลยตั้งใจอ่านแบบจริงจัง เพราะอยากได้ประสบการณ์ “คางะ begins” ซึ่งมันย้อนไปตั้งแต่สมัยที่คางะยังเป็นหนุ่มนักศึกษามหาวิทยาลัย

เปิดเรื่องด้วยการตายของหญิงสาวเพื่อนในกลุ่มของคางะ
การตายนั้นถูกตั้งข้อสงสัยว่าเป็นการฆ่าตัวตายหรือถูกฆาตกรรม
และถ้าเป็นการฆาตกรรม มันจะเป็นฆาตกรรมในห้องปิดตาย
คางะและเพื่อนๆ ในกลุ่มพยายามเสาะหาคำตอบด้วยตัวเอง

ไม่นานนัก เพื่อนในกลุ่มอีกคนก็ตาย
คราวนี้กลายเป็นว่าเพื่อนในกลุ่ม ตายในเวลาไล่เลี่ยกัน จนแทบไม่ต้องสงสัยเลยว่ามันต้องเกี่ยวข้องกับการตายครั้งก่อนแน่ๆ

“เซ็ตสึเง็ตสึขะ” หรือ “หิมะ พระจันทร์ ดอกไม้” เป็นพิธีชงชาเก่าแก่ที่คนญี่ปุ่นที่ไม่ได้อยู่สายชงชาก็คงไม่รู้จัก พิธีนี้มีคนอย่างน้อย 3 คนเข้าร่วม จะผลัดกันจับไพ่
ถ้าใครได้ไพ่หิมะ คนนั้นทำหน้าที่ดื่มชา
ถ้าใครได้ไพ่พระจันทร์ คนนั้นทำหน้าที่กินขนม
และถ้าใครได้ไพ่ดอกไม้ คนนั้นทำหน้าที่ชงชา
การตายเกิดขึ้นระหว่างที่กลุ่มเพื่อนคางะเข้าร่วมพิธีนี้
เรียกได้ว่าตายต่อหน้าต่อตาคนหลายคนเลย

ใครฆ่า และฆ่าได้ยังไง

แน่นอนว่าคางะฉายแววเทพออกมาตั้งแต่เป็นนักศึกษา
แม้จะไม่เฉียบเทพเหมือนเล่มที่เป็นตำรวจแล้ว แต่ก็ไม่ใช่ระดับธรรมดาสามัญแน่นอน
แรกๆ อาจจะดูเนือยๆ แต่ไม่เกินหนึ่งในสามเล่มก็เริ่มเข้าที่เข้าทาง
ดราม่าความสัมพันธ์ และมูลเหตุจูงใจในการฆ่าก็มาเต็มตามมาตรฐานเวทมนตร์เคโงะ
ตรึงคนอ่านให้ขมวดคิ้วไปจนถึงหน้าสุดท้าย

ถ้าอธิบายให้ชัดขึ้นคือ นี่คือเรื่องราวของกลุ่มเพื่อนสนิทสมัยเรียนมหาลัยของคางะ
มีทั้งเพื่อนที่รู้จักกันมาตั้งแต่ม.ปลาย เพื่อนของเพื่อน และเพื่อนในชมรมเคนโด้

เนื้อหาในเล่มแบ่งเป็น 4 ช่วงหลักๆ คือ
-ความกังวลใจของนักศึกษาปีสี่
-พิธีชงชา
-การแข่งขันเคนโด้
-บทสรุป

ชีวิตนักศึกษามหาลัยปี 4 กังวลใจอยู่ไม่กี่เรื่อง
1 เรื่องทำตัวจบ
2 เรื่องหางานทำในบริษัทที่มั่นคงหรือสายอาชีพที่มั่นคง
3 ชีวิตรัก บางคนก็ตั้งใจจะแต่งงาน

เพื่อนๆ ทุกคนในกลุ่มก็กังวลเรื่องนี้ คางะเองก็ลังเลว่าจะเป็นครูดีหรือเป็นตำรวจดี
แต่ด้วยความที่พ่อของเขาเป็นตำรวจ และไม่เคยใช้เวลาอยู่บ้านกับครอบครัวเลย
คางะจึงค่อนข้างแน่ใจว่าตัวเองไม่อยากเป็นเหมือนพ่อ เป็นครูน่าจะเหมาะกว่า

เนื้อหาในเล่มมีความต่างจากงานเขียนทั่วไปของคุณเคโงะ เพราะใช้เวลาปูเรื่องนานกว่าศพแรกจะปรากฎ
แต่ตอนจบบทนั้น ก็จบได้แบบฮือฮามากว่า... ทำไมพยานสองคนในที่เกิดเหตุให้การไม่ตรงกันเลย ทั้งที่เวลาต่างกันแค่ 15 นาทีเอง

เรื่องราวในเล่มยังคงดำเนินต่อไป ก้าวเข้าสู่ช่วงที่ 2 ""พิธีชงชา""
เราได้รู้ว่า อ่อ... เพื่อนๆ ในกลุ่มนี้ของคางะ เคยเป็นสมาชิกชมรมชงชา ก็เลยมีการลากเพื่อนๆ ในกลุ่มไปทำกิจกรรมดังกล่าวด้วยมาตั้งแต่สมัยม.ปลาย
โดยคุณครูที่ปรึกษาชมรมชงชา เป็นครูประจำชั้นของคางะด้วย ทั้งนั้นทุกคนจึงสนิทสนมกับคุณครูท่านนี้เป็นอย่างดี
รูปแบบการชงชาในเล่มชวนมึนงงเล็กน้อย แต่มีแผนผังประกอบ (ถ้าไม่มีคงจะงงกว่านี้ค่ะ)

ช่วงที่ 3 เป็นการโฟกัสกับการแข่งขันเคนโด้
ในเพื่อนกลุ่มนี้มีคนเล่นกีฬาแค่สองชนิด คือ เคนโด้กับเทนนิส
คางะและนามิกะเล่นเคนโด้ ฝีมือดีมากเป็นที่รู้จักในระดับประเทศ
ส่วนวาโคและฮานาเอะเล่นเทนนิสคู่ นี่ก็ฝีมือดีมากเช่นกัน เป็นตัวแทนมหาลัย
เราจะเห็นการฝึกซ้อม บรรยากาศวันแข่งจริง และความคิดของนักกีฬาขณะลงสนาม

ช่วงที่ 4 บทสรุปและคลี่คลาย
คางะในวันนั้นยังไม่ใช่ตำรวจ เขาก็เป็นเพียงนักศึกษาที่สงสัยเรื่องการตายไม่เป็นธรรมชาติ
ซึ่งดูจากหลักฐานแวดล้อมก็ไม่น่าจะใช่ฆ่าตัวตาย
ด้วยความที่เป็นคนนอก จะเข้าไปขอข้อมูล เก็บหลักฐานหรือสืบคดีก็ทำไม่ได้เต็มเม็ดเต็มหน่วย
และเพราะเรื่องมันคลี่คลายออกมาแบบนี้ ก็เลยทำให้เข้าใจว่าทำไมนายตำรวจคางะแบบที่เราเห็นๆ กันในซีรีส์ชุดนี้ดูเป็นตำรวจที่ใจดีและประนีประนอมทีเดียว

ฆาตกรรมหิมะ พระจันทร์ ดอกไม้"" จบเรื่องแถวๆ พิธีจบการศึกษา เราจึงยังไม่เห็นว่า... ก็แล้วทำไมคางะถึงมาเป็นตำรวจล่ะ?
เนื้อหาส่วนนี้คงอยู่ในเล่มอื่นที่เรายังอ่านไม่ถึง ก็จะค่อยๆ อ่านต่อไปค่ะ :-)

ที่แปลกอีกอย่างคือตอนจบ
นี่น่าจะเป็นครั้งแรกเลยที่เราเห็นคุณเคโงะเล่าตอนจบของทุกตัวละครให้ฟังค่ะ การคลี่คลายของแต่ละคนดูสมจริงมาก ถ้าพวกเค้ามีตัวตนจริงๆ ก็คงจะเป็นแบบนี้นั่นล่ะค่ะ",3,5 likes,66

ปมของเคโงะยังคงซับซ้อน มีปมซ้อนปม หักมุมแล้วหักมุมอีก
และสุดท้ายก็สร้างความร้าวรานให้คนอ่านอีกครั้ง

ที่อยากติงคือ สนพ. ที่อุตส่าห์ได้ต้นฉบับงานดีๆ ทำปกและรูปเล่มสวยงามน่าสะสม แต่แปลออกมาแล้วกลายเป็นหนังสือราคาถูกไปซะงั้น เข้าใจว่าผู้แปลเก่งภาษาญี่ปุ่นมากค่ะ แต่ถ้าได้ทำงานร่วมกับคนที่เก่งภาษาไทยด้วยจะยอดเยี่ยมมาก เพราะหลายประโยคในเรื่องแปลออกมาแล้วติดจะทื่อๆ ไปหน่อย บางประโยคก็ใช้คำฟุ่มเฟือย และมีคำผิดแบบที่อ่านไปครึ่งเล่มต้องเปิดไปท้ายเล่มดูชื่อคนพิสูจน์อักษรและ บ.ก. ด้วยความผิดหวัง

ตัวอย่างที่ผิดอย่างน่าละอายคือ ชื่อตัวละครหลัก ‘ไอฮาระ’ ที่เขียนเป็น ‘ไฮอาระ’ ในหน้า 217 กับ 235 และชื่อตัวละคร ‘นามิกะ’ ที่เขียนเป็น ‘มานิกะ’ ในหน้า 282 (โดยที่ในหน้าเดียวกัน ย่อหน้าข้างบนมีชื่อ นามิกะ เขียนอยู่ห่างออกไปแค่ 4 บรรทัดแท้ๆ)

ที่บ่นเยอะส่วนหนึ่งเพราะเป็นนิยายสืบสวนสอบสวนด้วยละมั้งคะ คนอ่านหนังสือประเภทนี้ส่วนใหญ่มักอ่านแบบเก็บทุกรายละเอียด ยิบย่อยแค่ไหนก็เจาะอยู่นั่นแล้ว เลยมีความคิดว่าคนทำหนังสือแนวนี้ (จริงๆ ก็ทุกแนว) ควรใส่ใจรายละเอียดมากๆ ไม่อย่างงั้นก็จะกลายเป็นดูถูกคนอ่านไปนะคะ",4,,66

จริงๆไม่ต้องอ่านตามลำดับเล่มก็ได้ แต่ถ้าอ่านตามลำดับจะเข้าใจปมต่างๆของคางะมากขึ้น

เรื่องราวในเล่มเกิดขึ้นสมัยคางะเป็นนักศึกษาปีที่สี่ เรียนคณะสังคมศาสตร์ ตอนนั้นความคิด สายตายังไม่คมกริบเหมือนตอนเป็นตำรวจแล้ว อ่านแล้วยังไม่ปิ๊งคางะซักเท่าไหร่

เนื้อเรื่องคร่าวๆคือกลุ่มเพื่อนคางะมีกันทั้งหมด 7 คน โดยสนิทกันมาตั้งแต่มัธยมปลาย วันหนึ่งมีเพื่อนคนหนึ่งตายไปลักษณะเหมือนฆ่าตัวตาย เรื่องเดิมยังไม่ทันซา เพื่อนสนิทอีกคนกลับตายไปอีก เกิดอะไรขึ้นกันแน่ในกลุ่มเพื่อนกลุ่มนี้ คนที่เราคิดว่าสนิทจริงๆแล้วเรารู้จักเค้ามากแค่ไหน เราจะกล้าเล่าทุกเรื่องให้เพื่อนฟังจริงหรือเปล่า หรือที่จริงแล้วในบางเรื่องเรากลับสะดวกใจที่จะคุยกับคนนอกมากกว่า เรื่องอะไรกันที่ทำให้เราตัดสินใจทรยศเพื่อนได้

เล่มนี้อ่านได้เรื่อยๆ ไม่เบื่อ ไม่หวือหวา คลายปมหมด แต่ยากหน่อยตรงปริศนาฆาตกรรมพิธีชงชา เล่นเอามึน แต่ทึ่งตรงที่เล่มนี้เขียนเมื่อ พ.ศ.2529 คือเนื้อเรื่องร่วมสมัยมาก ถ้าท้ายบทไม่มีบอกไว้ก้อไม่รู้นะ

อีกอย่างหนึ่งเรื่องนี้สะท้อนให้เห็นความกดดันอย่างสูงในสังคมญี่ปุ่น ต้องได้งานทำที่ดีๆ ถึงจะได้รับการยอมรับ ประวัติส่วนตัว คนใกล้ตัวต้องห้ามด่างพร้อย จริงๆมันก็คนละคนกันนะ แยกแยะหน่อย เพราะความกดดันแบบนี้เลยมีคนขาดสติ ทำได้ทุกอย่างเพื่อความสำเร็จของตนเอง ใครตายช่างมัน",4,,66

ตัวเล่มเน้นธีมมิตรภาพระหว่างเพื่อนในกลุ่มที่หลาย ๆ ครั้งก็ทำให้เราสงสัยขึ้นมาว่านี่เราสนิทกันจริง ๆ หรอ เรารู้เรื่องของคนอื่นมากแค่ไหนกัน เรารักกันมากพอที่จะทิ้งความเห็นแก่ตัวของเราไปได้ไหม

ความรู้สึกส่วนตัวคือเล่มนี้ไม่ได้ดำเนินเรื่องได้หวือหวามาก แต่ชอบการใส่ลูกเล่นความเป็นญี่ปุ่นลงไปอย่างการเล่นเคนโด้และพิธีชงชาเซ็ตสึเง็ตสึขะที่เป็นที่มาของชื่อเรื่อง ใครชื่นชอบวัฒนธรรมญี่ปุ่นอยู่แล้วก็น่าจะมีอารมณ์ร่วมกับคดีในเล่มนี้ได้ไม่ยาก สารภาพว่าตอนเฉลยคดีแอบงงเบา ๆ ต้องตั้งใจอ่านมาก ๆ 55555

ด้วยความที่เรื่องนี้ถูกเขียนขึ้นในปี 1986 กลิ่นความเรโทรจาง ๆ ก็เลยลอยออกมาเป็นระยะ แฝงมากับจุดเล็ก ๆ ในนิยายที่สื่อให้เห็นว่าญี่ปุ่นในยุคนั้นเป็นยังไง ทั้งค่านิยม การใช้ชีวิต และงานอดิเรกสุดฮิตในสมัยนั้น พอมาอ่านด้วยสายตาของคนในยุคหลังก็เป็นเรื่องที่น่าสนใจดี",4,4 likes,66

Là tập đầu tiên trong series về Thanh tra Kaga. Bối cảnh câu chuyện diễn ra khi Kaga đang là sinh viên năm cuối, Kaga và nhóm bạn của anh ấy sắp tốt nghiệp và họ sẽ phải đưa ra những dự định trong tương lai.
Cho đến một ngày, một người trong nhóm được phát hiện đã chết (được cho là tự sát), người tiếp theo thì bị hạ độc.

Chỉ là mình thấy diễn biến cực kỳ chậm, câu chuyện được miêu tả chi tiết đến phát chán, đọc đến 50% truyện mình bắt đầu mất hứng thú - dù vậy vẫn phải đọc cho xong.
Mình thích cách diễn giải về ""vụ án đầu"" rất thú vị, còn ở vụ án thứ hai về trà đạo rất phức tạp - mình hầu như lướt qua bởi độ mô tả của nó khiến mình nhức óc. Xét về động cơ mình khá ấn tượng, những cô cậu sinh viên sắp tốt nghiệp phải loay hoay lựa chọn dự định tương lai - kết hôn, tìm việc làm, những lựa chọn mà mình nghĩ ai đang và đã làm sinh viên sẽ hiểu được.

Mình thấy khá thú vị khi nhìn thấy một Kaga trẻ tuổi, cháy bỏng với bộ môn kendo, hay chỉ là tỏ tình với người anh ta yêu.

เป็นเรื่องเกี่ยวกับกลุ่มเพื่อนสนิท 7 คน มีคนหนึ่งคล้ายว่าฆ่าตัวตาย หรือเป็นฆาตกรรมในห้องที่ปิดตาย ต่อมามีอีกคนตายตามไป เป็นการตายในพิธีชงชา ท่ามกลางกลุ่มเพื่อน จึงเป็นเหตุให้ต้องตามสืบกัน

ในส่วนของการสืบหาตัวคนร้ายนั้น ค่อนข้างมึน เพราะต้องทำความเข้าใจกับอะไรหลาย ๆ อย่าง ตั้งแต่กติกากีฬาเคนโด้ ผังอะพาร์ตเม้นท์ที่เกิดเหตุ ลักษณะของกลอน ไปจนถึงลำดับขั้นของพิธีชงชา ที่เรียกว่าหิมะ พระจันทร์ ดอกไม้ ตามชื่อเรื่อง ถึงขนาดที่หนังสือต้องมีรูปประกอบให้ดู เล่นเอาเหนื่อยไปพอสมควร

แต่อีกส่วนที่มาคู่กันคือปมความสัมพันธ์ระหว่างเพื่อน นับว่าน่าสนใจ และสะท้อนให้เห็นค่านิยมบางอย่างของสังคมญี่ปุ่นในขณะนั้น

review_4288000953,Thk,"Oct 14, 2021","The build up was interesting, but the pacing somehow was very slow, even worse than Houkago (which is a more visceral read) - very uneven and hard to continue at times. The setup was a bit too complicated. probably out of reach for non-Japanese, and even worse off when translated. Near the end, you can see the beginnings where Higashino started with a archetypical Kaga-Galileo mix that eventually split off in the ""evolutionary cycle"" toward full-fledged Kaga and Galileo series.

review_4429493797,The.End.Notes 讀筆,"Jan 01, 2022","東野圭吾的加賀恭一郎系列中的第一本，《畢業──雪月花殺人遊戲》寫的加賀還在大學讀書，志願不是成為警察而是成為一位教師。

故事講述加賀恭一郎和他一班大學的好朋友中發生了命案。其中一個朋友在密室中去世，不知道是自殺還是他殺，而不久另一位好友亦在一個雪月花的茶道儀式中被殺，殺人犯就加賀的朋友當中。

看完很替加賀心痛惋惜。學生時代的朋友是很特別的，一起經歷成長，一起上課交功課，一起溫書準備考試，週末放假還會約出來hea。人長大了，那些情誼很難在工作的場所上再找到。

很好看的一本書，尤其是要去想殺手怎樣利用雪月花的茶道儀式去下手，逼讀者去認識雪月花的儀式和去思考它的次序中的巧妙。",4,0 likes,66

เรื่องย่อขี้เกียจเล่า (แบบนี้ก็ได้เหรอ) เอาเป็นว่ากลุ่มเพื่อนสนิทเจ็ดคนที่คบหากันมานานตั้งแต่สมัยมัธยม เกิดตายไปสองคนก่อนที่จะรับปริญญา คนร้ายอยู่ในกลุ่มเพื่อนนี่ละ จบ

พอฟังว่าเป็นเพื่อนที่คบหากันมานาน เลยรู้สึกว่าเหตุผลในการฆ่าดูอ่อนไปหน่อย ถึงจะมีเหตุผลในแง่ของตัวละคร แต่เรื่องแค่นั้นถึงขนาดฆ่าเพื่อนที่รู้จักกันมานานได้ง่าย ๆ แถมไม่ใช่พลั้งมือฆ่า แต่เป็นการฆ่าโดยไตร่ตรองไว้ก่อนด้วยนะ พอรู้สึกอย่างนี้เลยไม่ค่อยอินเท่าไหร่ เพื่อนนะไม่ใช่ผักปลา

แต่ถ้าตัดประเด็นเรื่องมูลเหตุจูงใจออก งานของฮิงาชิโนะ เคโงะก็ยังเล่าเรื่องได้น่าติดตามเหมือนเดิม โดยเฉพาะได้เห็นคางะสมัยลงแข่งเคนโด้ด้วยแล้ว ยิ่งรู้สึกตื่นเต้น เรื่องเล่าจากในเล่มอื่นที่ว่าคางะชนะเคนโด้ระดับประเทศ ก็ปรากฎในเล่มนี้นี่เอง

หนังสือเล่มนี้เป็นนิยายในชุดนักสืบเทงกะอิจิ ที่ให้อารมณ์สืบสวนสอบสวนผสมกับ comedy นิดๆ และเต็มไปด้วยการเสียดสีแดกดันนิยายแนวสืบสวนสอบสวน แถมบางครั้งตัวละครมีการปฏิสัมพันธ์กับคนอ่านอีกต่างหาก กลายเป็นงานนอกขนบโดยแท้

หนังสือแบ่งออกเป็นตอนสั้นๆ แยกขาดออกจากกัน เดินเรื่องด้วยคู่หูนักสืบบเทงกะอิจิกับสารวัตรโองาวาระ แค่วิธีการแบ่งเรื่องสั้นก็ฉีกขนบแล้ว เพราะแต่ละตอนจงใจแบ่งตามทริคที่เจอได้ในงานสืบสวนสอบสวน ไม่ว่าจะเป็น
- ฆาตกรรมในห้องปิดตาย
- ศพไร้หัว
- ฆ่าหั่นศพ
- อาวุธสังหารที่หายไป
ฯลฯ

โดยที่ทั้งสองคนมีการมา discuss กันนอกบทว่าตอนนี้กำลังดำเนินไปด้วยทริคอะไร เหมือนเป็นการคุยกับคนอ่านบวกกับให้ความรู้ของงานแนว suspense ควบคู่ไปด้วย
ส่วนตัวเนื้อเรื่องที่เป็นการสืบสวนสอบสวนก็ดำเนินไปได้ชวนติดตาม
ที่เจ๋งคือ แม้ว่าคนอ่านจะรู้ว่าตอนสั้นตอนนั้นๆ ผู้เขียนใช้ทริคอะไรในการเดินเรื่อง แต่ก็ยังเดาตอนจบหรือบทสรุปไม่ถูกอยู่ดี แถมยังเจอเฉลยแบบหักมุมให้อึ้งเกินความคาดหมายหลายตอน

อ่านจบแบบเพลินๆ อาจจะดราม่าไม่เข้มข้นเหมือนงานอื่นๆ แต่เด่นมากเรื่องทริคสืบสวนสอบสวนที่ Keigo จัดเต็มมา 12 ทริค
อ่านเล่มนี้จบแล้วคุณจะอ่านหนังสือสืบสวนสอบสวนไม่เหมือนเดิม
คือคุณจะกลับไปอ่านงานแนว suspense พร้อมกับความรู้ในหัวว่าทริคไหนเป็นยังไง และทำไมนักเขียนถึงต้องเลือก setting อย่างนั้นอย่างนี้ มิหนำซ้ำอาจจะถึงขั้นเบ้ปากเวลาที่ไปเจองานที่ไม่สมเหตุสมผล ไม่ persuasive ได้เลยทีเดียว",3,5 likes,68

review_1624915899,Mizuki,"Apr 30, 2016","This collection of short stories is supposed to be a parody to the classical 'locked room' murder mystery genre. A lot of people seem to enjoy it but sadly, in this book (and the same goes for Keigo's Laughing series) the mockery is *way* too obvious to a point all the subtly and jokes just simply vanish into the thin air.

I don't like the shallow, stupid characters--I know they are supposed to be stupid, still they are so stupid that they don't even look like actual people.

I can't stand the pointless stories--I know they are supposed to be pointless, but the author shows me no insight other than 'Look! I'm making fun out of one of the overused murder mystery's cliches!' And the author is making his points in such a smug, 'smarter-than-you' manner which annoys me a great deal.

I can't stand the of forced, tasteless sense of humor and all those lame jokes that filled the entire book. I mean, a parody is bad when the jokes are entirely not funny.

Even the TV drama-adaptation basing on this book is also stupid and forced on so many levels, what a total failure!",1,,68

The fourth-wall breaking is not particularly clever. The author intended mostly for such a premise to generate humor, but such attempts fall flat because they consist solely of the protagonists pointing out various mystery novel tropes that are happening around them and commenting on how silly or unrealistic such tropes are. Beyond that, the premise doesn't go very far.

The premise even serves to worsen the mysteries, with most of them having sub-par and half-assed solutions just to accommodate the fourth-wall breaking (one of the mysteries even lacks a solution). There are a couple of mildly brilliant ones, but those are not worth dredging through this thirteen-story collection for.",1,1 like,68

review_4640475481,bubblemustard,"Jun 16, 2022","** spoiler alert ** ก่อนอื่นเลย ปกสวยมากกกกก พรีเมียมสุดๆ แค่เอามือลูบปกก็มีความสุขแล้ว (ปกติไม่ค่อยชอบปกของสนพ.นี้เท่าไหร่ ทั้งอาร์ตเวิคทั้งตัวกระดาษ มันรักษายากมากกกก ยิ่งปกสีขาวคือไม่นานก็เหลือง แถมเปื้อนง่ายมาก ทั้งที่ก็ว่ารักษาดีแล้วแท้ๆ ขอบ่นนิดนึง 🥲)

เรื่องนี้เป็นนิยายดราม่าแฟนตาซี เกี่ยวกับลูปเวลา ครอบครัว การได้เกิดมาใช้ชีวิต จริงๆ เราชอบเนื้อเรื่องตอนต้นกับตอนท้ายมาก (ให้ตรงนี้สามดาว) ส่วนช่วงกลางเรื่องเรารู้สึกว่ามันน่าเบื่อไปหน่อย (สองดาวที่หายไป) แล้วก็รำคาญคาแรคเตอร์ทาคุมิช่วงวัยรุ่นเลือดร้อนด้วย อ่านไปก็อยากฟาดไปสักหลายที โทคิโอะนับว่าใจเย็นมาก นับถือจริงๆ

สิ่งที่เรื่องนี้ให้เราเก็บกลับมาคิดคือ
1. การให้กำเนิด=การให้ชีวิตจริงๆหรือเปล่า
จากเหตุผลที่แม่ของทาคุมิตัดสินใจคลอดทาคุมิออกมา แต่สุดท้ายเลี้ยงไม่ไหว ต้องฝากลูกไว้กับพ่อแม่บุญธรรม และทาคุมิที่ตัดสินใจให้โทคิโอะเกิดมาทั้งที่รู้อยู่แล้วว่ามีโรคทางพันธุกรรมที่รุนแรงติดตัวมาด้วย

2. อนาคตไม่ใช่แค่วันพรุ่งนี้
เปรียบเทียบระหว่างชีวิตของทาคุมิในสมัยวัยรุ่นที่เกิดมาแข็งแรงดี ทำตัวยังไงก็ได้ไปวันๆ เพราะคิดว่ายังไงๆ ก็มีวันพรุ่งนี้ให้ได้ใช้ กับโทคิโอะที่มีชีวิตอยู่แบบวันต่อวัน ยังพยายามที่จะเรียนหนังสือบนเตียงคนไข้ และทำอะไรหลายต่อหลายอย่าง รวมถึงการช่วยเหลือคนในนาทีสุดท้าย

เฮ้อ ซึ้งหัวใจจัง ;-;

สรุปก็คือเราไม่ค่อยชอบเส้นเรื่องตอนไปตามไล่ล่าหาตัวประกัน นอกนั้นชอบหมดเลย เนื้อเรื่องไม่มีอะไรซับซ้อน และตอนจบประทับใจมากๆ

ป.ล. อ่านเรื่องนี้แล้วแอบนึกถึง พรุ่งนี้ผมจะเดตกับเธอคนเมื่อวาน+your name เลย แต่เรื่องนี้เขียนขึ้นมาก่อน เลยยิ่งรู้สึกว่าอ.เคโงะนี่เจ๋งจัง",3,2 likes,69

review_4773185978,Siwabhorn Anothaisintawee,"Jul 01, 2022","โทคิโอะ ชายผู้ย้อนเวลากลับไปหาพ่อเมื่อ 20 กว่าปีก่อน ด้วยคำใบ้เดียวคือ ""ฮานะยะชิกิ""

เขาต้องช่วยพ่อ ที่เขาเปิดเผยความสัมพันธ์ที่แท้จริงไม่ได้ ช่วยเหลือแฟนสาวที่หายตัวไปอย่างลึกลับ จนได้รู้ว่าเหตุการณ์นี้มันพัวพันกับเรื่องราวใหญ่โตกว่าที่คิด แถมระหว่างทางยังต้องมาช่วยไขปมปัญหาชีวิตพ่ออีกด้วย


ทำไมอ่านรีวิวคนไม่ชอบเรื่องนี้กันเยอะหล่ะ เราว่ามันดีออก ถึงตอนแรกๆ จะทนความโง่ งี่เง่า ไม่เอาถ่านของพ่อไม่ค่อยได้ ชนิดที่ว่าถ้าย้อนเวลากลับไปเจอพ่อเป็นแบบนี้ คงอยากจะรีบหนีกลับมายุคปัจจุบันแทบไม่ทัน

แต่ระหว่างเส้นทางการผจญภัยของเรื่อง ก็มีบรรยากาศสนุกๆ ที่ 2 หนุ่มได้ร่วมเผชิญไปด้วยกัน มีเหตุการณ์ดีๆ ที่จะค่อยๆ หล่อหลอมให้พ่อกลายเป็นผู้ใหญ่ที่ได้เรื่องขึ้น ถ้าไม่นับเรื่องย้อนเวลาแล้วเรื่องราวก็ถือได้ว่าสมเหตุสมผลเลยทีเดียว

อ่านไป หงุดหงิดกับ ‘ทาคุมิ’ ช่วงวัยรุ่นเหลือเกิน ทำไมทำตัวโง่งมเยี่ยงนี้ มัวแต่ยึดติดว่าถูกพ่อแม่ทิ้งเลยไม่รักตัวเอง พยายามใช้ชีวิตติดลบตลอดเวลา ฉันเหนื่อยแทน 😤😤

ถ้าฉันเป็น ‘โทคิโอะ’ ที่ย้อนอดีตมาเจอวัยรุ่นของพ่อนี่คงกลอกตาจนตาขวิด 🙄🙄

——————————————————————-

จริงๆสิ่งที่ติดอยู่ในใจเราคือการที่โทคิโอะเกิดมามากกว่า

- ถ้ารู้อยู่แล้วว่าลูกมีโอกาสจะเป็นโรคที่ถ่ายทอดทางกรรมพันธ์ุร้ายแรงต้องทรมานและตายตั้งแต่อายุยังน้อย พ่อแม่ควรจะเสี่ยงมีลูกหรือไม่ มันคือความเห็นแก่ตัวหรือความรักกันแน่นะ

- เด็กที่เลือกเกิดไม่ได้ เอาเข้าจริงจะรู้สึกอย่างไร จะรู้สึกขอบคุณที่เกิดมามั้ยหรือจะเสียใจไม่น่าเกิดมา

ที่ติดใจเพราะโรคถ่ายทอดทางกรรมพันธุ์แบบที่อายุสั้นลงแน่นอน ระบบประสาทเสียหายมันมีอยู่จริง
ในชีวิตจริงคนเหล่านี้เป็นยังไงกันบ้างนะ",4,,69

นิยายเกี่ยวกับลูกที่เดินทางข้ามเวลามาหาพ่อสมัยตั้งแต่ยังเป็นวัยรุ่นไม่เอาถ่าน ไม่ได้เรื่องได้ราว พึ่งพาไม่ได้ หน้าโง่ อวดเก่งทะนงตน จนจับพลัดจับผลูเข้าไปเอี่ยวกับเรื่องราวที่เกี่ยวข้องกับคดีการติดสินบนของหน่วยงานภาครัฐและบริษัทขนาดใหญ่ ใช้ชีวิตโง่ๆ มุทะลุไปมา เอาตัวเองไปเสี่ยงตาย จนสุดท้ายก็ตามสไตล์หนังสือนะ ตัวเองก็ต้องชนะตลอด แล้วเข้าไปเปิดปมเรื่องราวสมัยเด็กๆที่โดนทอดทิ้งมาจากครอบครัวผู้ให้กำเนิด ความเกลียดชังที่มีมาตั้งแต่สมัยวัยรุ่น เปลี่ยนแปลงไปเป็นความรู้สึกกตัญญูขอบคุณ เพียงไม่กี่วันหลังจากที่ได้รับรู้ความจริง ซาบซึ้งจนน้ำตาจะไหล ชีวิตดำเนินต่อไปจนกระทั่งได้รับโอกาสดีๆ ในชีวิตก็เปลี่ยนไปจากหน้ามือเป็นหลังมือ

พิมพ์ไปเบะปากไป เป็นหนังสือที่ผู้อ่านชาวญี่ปุ่นส่งเสียงให้เป็น 1 ใน 10 มีนิยายสุดประทับใจตลอดกาล

review_3411845678,Mary Ann,"Jul 09, 2020","This book's got it all: Suspense, death, romance, friendship, high-school life, teenage ego... you name it. Although the characters and settings are nothing out of the ordinary, the author managed to weave a thrilling tale into an incredibly normal world, somehow making the story all the more gripping. Throughout the book, readers get to delve deep into the main character's internal self and experience his struggles and thought processes in exceptional detail. So many times, his internal struggles just tore my heart apart.

I have to say that Higashino is not content with just a simple protagonist versus antagonist, even to the end it is hard to point out who is to blame. In fact, the story suggested that nobody meant for all these tragic events to happen, yet at the same time, everyone's actions and choices potentially contributed to the build-up of this tragedy, thus, in a way, all are responsible.

Finally, I love how the author also incorporated, at a broader scale, certain social issues, such as teenage pregnancies, flawed education systems and health problems caused by unethical companies.

Yet despite all the chaos, the author still managed to wrap it all up in a warm and satisfying way.",5,1 like,71

這本是繼東野的出道作品《放學後》，第二本校園推理小說，剛好《放學後》也是我初次接觸東野的作品。

那本《放學後》是10年前看的所以已經忘了具體的內容，唯一記得的只有女學生和體育老師的不倫戀。
這本《同級生》也同樣是日系校園推理調調，仍脫離不了高中生未婚懷孕、師生戀、兩家庭間糾葛的窠臼，還有千篇一律以女學生死亡作為事件的開端，然而結局都是豁然開朗，原來當初那些碎片串連起來，每件事原來都存在著因果(廢話），主題幾乎繞著這些點打轉，不過除了這個之外，校園推理還能寫什麼？ 🧐

作者會寫這本書源於他從小就討厭老師這種自以為出色的人，與其說是討厭老師，不如說是討厭那些對色慾金錢有興趣的成人...
為人師表者或是為人父母者真的要好好以身作則，你的言行舉止孩童們全看在眼裡，請不要再說他只是孩子什麼都不懂，他們純粹單純的雙眼比你們看得更加清楚。

總之，前面說的看起來很無趣，其實作者還是寫得讓人想繼續看下去😂 這個故事很普通，可能發生在你我周遭過，就是一個高中男生讓一個女孩懷孕，不過他是在女生死後才知道她有了自己的孩子(因為他們不是那種關係），也意外得知女方的死跟懷孕那麼點相關聯、不僅如此，學校的老師也推了一把⋯ 問題ㄧ一浮現，追根究底，仍是因為感情糾紛。
情感糾葛世界各地都在發生，真的是普通到不能再普通的事。",4,,71

Thế này nhé, rõ ràng quyển này thiên về phần tâm lý nên hơi chậm, nhưng mình thích nó. Diễn biến về phát triển tâm lý nhân vật từ lúc còn là trẻ con khi lớn lên. Cách mà cuộc sống của Tajima sụp đổ rất đáng thương, thậm chí những kẻ mang trong mình ác ý lại bắt nạt và bỏ rơi họ, cách con người đấu tranh giữa việc ""Có nên bước qua cánh cửa giết người kia hay không?"" được viết khá ổn. Có rất nhiều phân đoạn khiến mình phát tức.



Tuy nhiên là mình chỉ thích mấy phần đầu thôi. Những phần sau thì thôi rồi, câu chuyện dài dòng và đưa ra những thứ khiến mà mình không quan tâm, chán hẳn hơn với phần đầu. Nếu bạn muốn nhìn thấy tâm lý chần chừ, phân vân thực sự của con người thì có lẽ bạn nên đọc, có thể sẽ phát điên về sự chần chừ và phân vân đó :)))",2,28 likes,74

อ่านเล่มนี้แล้วหงุดหงิดมาก ทั้งที่หงุดหงิดขนาดนั้นแต่ยิ่งอ่านยิ่งถลำลึก ยิ่งอ่านยิ่งติดหนึบเหมือนอยู่ในหลุมทรายดูด รู้ตัวอีกทีก็อ่านจนจบแล้ว อ่านไปถอนหายใจไป

อ่านประตูฆาตกรเหมือนกำลังเล่นเกมจีบหนุ่ม (สาว)
เหตุการณ์1:…
ตัวเลือก : ฆ่า หรือ หนี

เลือกฆ่า เกมจบ เลือกหนีเกมส์เดินหน้าต่อ

คือมายเนี่ย เลือกฆ่าอยู่แล้ว ฆ่าตั้งแต่แรก จบตั้งแต่ 100 หน้าแรก ขอโทษด้วยจริงๆ ที่ไม่อาจเป็นคนดีได้ในนิยายเคโงะเพราะศีลธรรมมันผิดเพี้ยนไปทั้งหมด

แต่ด้วยความที่มันผิดเพี้ยนไปหมดเนี่ย คำถามสำคัญคือ ถึงขนาดต้องฆ่าแกงกันเลยหรือ (ใช่ ถึงขนาดนั้นแหละว้อย)

มายพยายามเข้าใจคัตสึยูกินะแบบว่า คนอะไรมันจะโง่ให้หลอกซ้ำหลอกซากได้ขนาดนั้นวะ แต่พอคิดไปคิดมา คือคัตสึยูกิก็ไม่ได้โง่หรอก มีหลายครั้งหลายคราที่รู้ว่ามันแปลก รู้ว่าไม่ใช่ แต่ใจอ่อนต่างหาก เป็นคนดีมากเกินไปต่างหาก ดีจนเรารู้สึกว่าอยากทำให้มันแปดเปื้อน กลายเป็นว่าเข้าใจคุโระโมจิมากกว่าอีก

หว้า นอกจากจะเปิดประตูฆาตกรแล้วก้าวข้ามไปดันอยู่ฝั่งตัวร้ายอีกต่างหาก ฮือ นิยายทดสอบศีลธรรมในใจชัดๆ",1,2 likes,74
review_3959485025,Thanawat,"May 04, 2021","“คุณจะฆ่าคนๆ นึง ได้จริงๆ หรือ?”

ที่สุดของที่สุดจริงๆ นี่คือหนังสือที่ตรึงเอาไว้ ก่อกวนจิตใจ ปั่นป่วนอารมณ์ และบีบคั้นเฆี่ยนตีมโนสำนึกเป็นที่สุด

เป็นหนังสือที่เมื่อคุณไปอ่านแล้ว ทุกๆ 50 หน้าจะบอกกับตัวเอกของเรื่องว่า “เฮ้ย ฆ่าซะทีสิ”
หนังสือพาไปถึงจุดนั้นจริงๆ จุดที่คุณจะเชียร์ให้ใช้ศาลเตี้ย เชียร์ให้ใช้การฆาตกรรมแก้ปัญหา เพราะมันช่างสมควรแก่เหตุ และทางออกที่ไม่เห็นว่าวิธีการไหนจะมาทดแทนได้อีกแล้ว

หนังสือนิยายสัญชาติญี่ปุ่น ขนาดห้าร้อยหน้า ฝีมือมหาเทพเคโงะเล่มนี้ มอบประสบการณ์สุดพิศวงให้กับคนอ่านจริงๆ

เรื่องราวของชายหนุ่มลูกชายทัตแพทย์ฐานะ ครอบครัวสุขสันต์คนหนึ่ง ที่เกิดเหตุพลิกผัน ครอบครัวแตกสลาย จนกลายเป็นคนหาเช้ากินค่ำ ความสัมพันธ์กับคนในอดีตถูกตัดขาดทั้งหมด เหลือไว้เพียงชายที่ชื่อ “คุระโมจิ” คนเดียวเท่านั้น ที่เป็นเพื่อนเก่าในวัยประถมที่ยังวนเวียนติดต่อปฏิสัมพันธ์กันอยู่

“คุระโมจิ” นี่แหละ เป็นแกนและเป็นตัวหลักของเรื่อง ที่นอกจาก character ที่สุด charm แล้วยังเป็นตัวละครที่เคโงะทุ่มทุนสร้าง ปั้นตัวตนและนิสัยจนคนอ่านรังเกียจและโกรธแค้นระดับที่อยากจะมอบปลายทางของชีวิตที่เจ็บปวดให้สาสมกับพฤติกรรมสุดชั่ว
“คุระโมจิ” นี่เลวแบบสุดขั้ว ถ้าอ่านแล้วไม่เกลียดนี่นับถือหัวจิตหัวใจเลย ไม่ได้เลวแบบกักขฬะ อันธพาล ใช้การย่ำยีทางกายภาพ แต่เป็นคนเลวแบบใช้มันสมอง ทั้งโกหก ต้มตุ้น กลอกลวง วางแผน สมรู้ร่วมคิด ทำลาย
เป็นคนเลวสุดฉลาดที่ใช้สมองสุดเฉียบไปในทางสุดเลว
ผมคิดว่าคนอ่านหลายคนเดินผ่าน “ประตูฆาตกร” ไปหลายครั้งหลายคราระหว่างที่ได้อ่านหนังสือเล่มนี้

“ประตูฆาตกร” เป็นประตูที่กั้นสถานะระหว่าง “การไม่เป็นฆาตกร” กับ “การเป็นฆาตกร”
ประตูนี้เป็นประตูที่อยู่ในจินตภาพ
ประตูนี้เป็นประตูทางจิตวิทยา
มันต้องมีแรงจูงใจประกอบกับสิ่งแวดล้อมและตัวกระตุ้นที่พอเหมาะพอเจาะ คนธรรมดาๆ นี่แหละ จะเปิดและเดินผ่านประตูนี้เข้าไปสู่หนทางสู่การเป็นฆาตกรเต็มตัว
และเคโงะก็เล่าเรื่องได้ยั่วยวน จูงใจให้เผลอเชียร์ให้ตัวเอกเปิดประตูนี้เข้าไปซ้ำแล้วซ้ำอีก

เป็นอีกครั้งที่มหาเทพเคโงะร่ายเวทมนตร์ให้ปั่นป่วน โบยตีมโนสำนึกคนอ่าน จนอ่านจบแล้วก็ยังมานั่งตั้งคำถามกับประสบการณ์สุดสะพรึงว่า “นี่เราอยากให้คนนี้ถูกฆ่าตายเลยหรือนี่?”

ผมคิดว่าเคโงะยังคงเป็นนักเขียนที่เล่นกับประเด็นทางสังคมได้ดีมาก เช่นเดียวกับเล่นเรื่องจิตใจคน
คุณต้องมีมูลเหตุจูงใจมากขนาดไหนถึงจะฆ่าคนได้?
เคโงะให้คำตอบหนึ่งไว้ในหนังสือเล่มนี้ และคนที่จะได้รับประสบการณ์นั้นๆ ก็คือตัวคนอ่านเอง
นอกจากนี้ เคโงะยังกระทุ้งให้เราระลึกเสมอว่า อย่าไปต้มตุ๋น หลอกลวง เอาเปรียบ สร้างความเคียดแค้นให้กับใครเพื่อที่จะให้ตัวเองได้ประโยชน์ เพราะเราไม่มีทางรู้หรอกว่านั่นจะเป็นเชื้อไฟ หรือเป็นชนวน ผลักให้คนๆ นั้นข้ามผ่านประตูฆาตกร มาฆ่าเราในภายหลังได้

ผมชอบเรื่องยาวของเคโงะเสมอ
และเรื่อง “ประตูฆาตกร” นี้ก็ไม่ลังเลที่จะจัดอยู่ในหมวดหนังสือที่ชอบมาก
แต่ถ้าจะหยิบมาอ่านอีกครั้ง คงต้องพรรคเว้นช่วงสักหน่อย

เล่มนี้เป็นผลงานคุณเคโงะอีกเล่มที่หดหู่มาก แนวๆพระอาทิตย์เที่ยงคืนเลย

ตัวเอก’ทาจิมะ’โดนชักใยโดยเพื่อนของตัวเอง’คุระโมจิ’ ตั้งแต่เด็กจนโต นำพาไปเจอกับเรื่องเลวร้ายมากมาย ครอบครัวล่มจม บ้านแตก แยกทาง บางเรื่องคิดว่าร้ายพอแล้ว มันยังร้ายกว่าไปได้อีก โอ๊ยยย อ่านแล้วความดันขึ้น แถมทาจิมะไม่รู้ตัว โลกสวยให้โดยหลอกซ้ำแล้วซ้ำเล่า ส่วนคุระโมจิก็อิจฉาเพื่อน อยากให้เพื่อนตกต่ำถึงที่สุด

review_4061619470,loonchies,"May 04, 2022","“มนุษย์น่ะเป็นสิ่งมีชีวิตที่อิจฉาหรือเกลียดชังคนอื่นได้แค่เพราะเรื่องไม่เป็นเรื่อง”

การผิดศีลธรรมอันซับซ้อนในครอบครัว และความสัมพันธ์อันบิดเบี้ยว
การเอาชีวิตรอดและความเห็นแก่ตัวของคนในสังคมสีเทาจนเกือบดำ
การเอาเปรียบเมื่อมีโอกาส

เรื่องราวของเด็กชายคนหนึ่งที่มาเล่าถึงบุคคลที่อยู่รอบ ๆ เขา และความสัมพันธ์ที่หลากหลาย เหตุการณ์ที่สอนและปลูกฝังความคิดบางอย่าง
เล่าให้ฟังและให้คิดตามว่าเด็กคนนี้พบเจอเรื่องราวอะไรมา พฤติกรรมของคนรอบข้างส่งผลอะไรกับความคิดเขาบ้าง
จนวันนึงที่เด็กชายคนนั้นเติบโตเป็นหนุ่ม แล้วก็อาจจะกำลังเดินตามรอยอะไรบางอย่างจนอาจจะกลายเป็นสิ่งที่เขาเกลียดโดยไม่รู้ตัว

ขอปรับมือให้กับการสร้างเรื่องราว รายละเอียดตัวละคร ของผู้เขียนจริง ๆ
ใส่ใจรายละเอียดมาก พูดมาทีละนิดทีละหน่อยเหมือนเป็นคำบรรยายฉากทั่วไป
หรือบางเหตุการณ์ที่ดูสร้างอิมแพคเยอะแต่ก็เล่าเหมือนเป็นเรื่องธรรมดา
เทคนิคพูดน้อยแต่ได้มาก เล่าโดยไม่ต้องเล่า
ตรงนี้เป็นส่วนหนึ่งที่ทำให้งานเขียนอ.เคโงะเป็นที่นิยมขนาดนี้ด้วยมั้ง
เพราะรู้สึกสมจริง ด้วยเรื่องเล็ก ๆ น้อย ๆ นี่ละ
หรือแม้กระทั่งข้อมูลที่เราคิดว่าคงไม่ได้สำคัญอะไร แต่จริง ๆ คือคิดมาแล้ว จัดวางไว้หย่อนไว้เพื่อเอามาใช้ในเวลาที่เหมาะสม

เขียนเรื่องราวคนเหี้ยพร้อมเหตุผลหว่านล้อมได้เจ๋งจริง ๆ
ได้รู้เทคนิคหลอกลวงชาวบ้านด้วย

อ่านไปก็หงุดหงิดว่าโอ๊ยทำไมโง่ซ้ำแล้วซ้ำเล่า โมโหแล้วไม่เรียนรู้เสียหน่อยหรือ
แต่ก็มานึกดูว่าถ้าเป็นเรื่องจริง ๆ มองจากนอกหม้อก็เห็นกบที่ถูกต้มก็พูดได้ กบเองไม่รู้ตัวหรอก

ต้องระวังอย่าเอาตัวเองไปเป็นแบบทาจิมะ แล้วก็ต้องระวังว่าในชีวิตตัวเราเองมีคนแบบคุระโมจิไหม //อ่านไปก็กลัว กลัวว่าจะมี คนที่แบบเจอในชีวิตแล้วจะทำให้เรางง ๆ เอ้ะ ๆ ตลอด
แล้วก็อย่าไปทำตัวเป็นคุระโมจิของใคร อย่าไปทำให้ใครต้องเป็นทาจิมะ

ดังคำกล่าวของอาจารย์พาโถท่านหนึ่งที่ว่า
มะเร็งก็เหมือนการปลูกต้นไม้ มันต้องมีเมล็ด มีดิน และต้องมีการรดน้ำพรวนดินใส่ปุ๋ย
ไม่มีเมล็ด รดน้ำใส่ปุ๋ยให้ดินยังไงมันก็ไม่งอก
มีเมล็ดมีดิน แต่ไม่รดน้ำใส่ปุ๋ยหรือนาน ๆ ทีถึงทำ ต้นไม้มันก็รอดลำบาก
ขาดอย่างใดอย่างหนึ่งไปต้นไม้ก็คงจะเติบโตได้ยาก
เช่นเดียวกับการกลายร่างและเติบโตของมะเร็ง
เรื่องชิบหายในชีวิตก็เช่นกัน
อาจจะมีหลายเรื่องที่อยู่นอกเหนือการควบคุมของเรา แต่บางเรื่องที่เราควบคุมได้ก็อย่าพาตัวเองมุ่งสู่ความชิบหาย

ไม่คิดเลยว่าจะได้ข้อคิดมากมายจากหนังสือเล่มนี้นะ
ตอนแรกนึกว่าเป็นแนวการดิ้นรนหาทางก่อคดีและเอาตัวรอดของฆาตกรโรคจิต แต่คือคนละเรื่องเลย
แต่สารที่ได้คือเป็นเครื่องมือเตือนใจเวลาใช้ชีวิตและตัดสินใจต่าง ๆ ได้ดี
ล้ำลึก

ตอนจบยิ่งแบบ ตบเข่าฉาด! ไม่ได้เป็นเรื่องเกินคาดหวัง คิดไว้แล้วว่ามันต้องมีเรื่องนี้ แต่แบบ
ความสุดยอดของเล่มนี้คืออะไรอีกรู้ไหม
มันคือการที่ผู้เขียนทำให้ความสัมพันธ์ของคนเขียนและคนอ่านเป็นแบบความสัมพันธ์ของคุระโมจิกับทาจิมะ
และใช่ผู้เขียนเป็นคุระโมจิ ทำให้คนอ่านรู้สึกต้องยักแย่ยักยัน หงุดหงิดกับการตัดสินใจตัวละคร แต่ก็พยายามทำความเข้าใจและคงความสัมพันธ์นี้ต่อไปและหวังว่าจะได้รู้อะไรมากขึ้น
แล้วก็อดทนมาจนถึงตอนจบ

ที่พังลงไปด้วยน้ำมือของคุณนักเขียน
ทุกครั้งที่มีทางแยก นักเขียนจะผลักดันให้ตัวละครเลือกทางผิดเสมอๆ
ครั้งแล้วครั้งเล่า จนเราไม่ลุ้นอีกแล้ว
ได้แต่ตามดูว่าสุดท้ายแล้ว ชีวิตแกจะไปจบลงตรงไหน

เป็นนิยายที่อ่านจบแล้วมีคำสองคำวนเวียนอยู่ในหัว
คำแรกคือ “เกลียด” ส่วนอีกคำคือ “น่าทึ่ง”
อ่านคำปิดท้ายจากผู้แปล ยิ่งคิดว่าใช่เลย
คือตลอดการอ่าน เราคิดว่าเมื่อไรจะผ่านมันไปเสียที
แต่ก็เลิกอ่านไม่ได้ เพราะอยากรู้ว่า
สุดท้ายแล้วมันจะจบลงอย่างไร
ส่วนความรู้สึกหลังอ่านจบแล้วนั้น ..
ก็อย่างที่บอกไปแล้วน่ะแหละ
สุดยอดเกินไปแล้ว ..
มันทั้งชวนให้เกลียด และน่าทึ่งจริงๆ

มีสิ่งหนึ่งที่ขัดใจเรา ..
เตือน!! ข้างล่างนี้สปอยล์แรงนะคะ

เชื่อเหอะ ว่าเกือบทุกคนที่อ่าน
ต้องลุ้นให้ตัวละครก้าวข้ามประตูฆาตกรไปให้ได้สักที
ผู้เขียนปูเรื่องมาว่าคาสึยูกิเป็นลูกทันตแพทย์
แถมตอนเด็กๆ ยังค้นคว้าเรื่องของยาพิษมาตั้งเยอะ
เราก็คาดหวังว่าจะฉลาดกว่านี้
ที่ไหนได้ โดนหลอกตลอด ทำอะไรไม่เคยคิดหน้าคิดหลัง
เวลาที่เหตุเกิดไปแล้วนี่ฉลาดนัก
แต่ก่อนเกิดเหตุ ไม่เคยเอะใจอะไรเลย
ดาหน้าเข้าหาปัญหาเองตลอด
จะโทษคนที่อยากจะหลอกฝ่ายเดียวก็ไม่ได้
เพราะตัวเองโง่เองด้วย

แถมจะฆ่าคนแต่ละที เอะอะบีบคอ
ความรู้ยาพิษที่ปูมา แทบไม่เคยได้ใช้เลย

เหมือนเป็นความตั้งใจของผู้เขียน
ที่จะทำให้คนอ่านขัดใจตั้งแต่ต้นจนจบ
เป็นเรื่องที่ตอนอ่านก็ไม่สนุก
เราเฝ้ารอให้คาสึยูกิ ฆ่าคุระโมจิได้สักที
แต่ก็ไม่เคยสำเร็จ
จวบจนกระทั้งตอนจบ .. ก็ไม่สนุก
คาสึยุกิ ที่ชีวิตน่าจะไปได้ดีแล้ว
กลับมาตัดสินใจฆ่าเอาตอนนี้ ..
แล้วชีวิตต่อจากนั้นก็ถูกปล่อยให้ค้างเติ่ง ไม่เล่าต่อ
เรื่องนี้มีคนทำตามใจสำเร็จเพียงคนเดียว คือผู้เขียน!!

(ยังบ่นต่อไม่จบ)
คือถ้าปูเรื่องมาให้บิดเบี้ยวขนาดนี้
คาสึยูกิ ควรจะลงมือฆ่าไปตั้งนานแล้วหรือเปล่า
ไม่น่าปล่อยเวลามาเนิ่นนาน เรื่องมันควรจะจบกับไอ้เพื่อนคนนี้ไปตั้งแต่ต้นเรื่องแล้ว
แล้วเขาจะไปฆ่าใครต่อ อะไรยังไง .. ก็ค่อยเล่าเรื่องต่อ
มันก็จะไม่อึดอัดขนาดนี้ มันยังมีอะไรให้ลุ้นกว่านี้

แต่ก็โอเคนะ
รู้สึกว่ามันหนืดมันยืดมันเวิ่นเว้อไปบ้าง

ชีวิตของคนที่ถูกชักใย อาจไม่ใช่แค่ตัวละครในหนังสือเล่มนี้
แต่อาจจะเป็นชีวิตผู้อ่านที่กำลังอ่านหนังสือเล่มนี้อยู่ด้วยก็ได้
พอหยิบหนังสือเล่มนี้มาอ่าน ก็เหมือนมีคนอย่างคุระโมจิเข้ามาในชีวิต
อ่านไปเรื่อยๆ ก็เหมือนได้จดหมายลูกโซ่ที่ต้องส่งให้คนอื่นไปเป็นทอดๆ
ตัวเราเองก็ต้องอ่านไปเรื่อยๆ (เพราะอยากรู้เนื้อเรื่องมันจะดำเนินไปในทางไหน)
ยิ่งอ่านยิ่งหงุดหงิด
พออ่านถึงจุดที่ตัวละครหลักจะไปฆ่าคุระโมจิ
แต่สุดท้ายก็ฆ่าไม่ได้เพราะใจอ่อนต่างๆนานา
กลายเป็นตัวเราเองที่เกิดความหงุดหงิดขึ้น
นั่นก็อาจเป็นสิ่งที่คุระโมจิต้องการก็ได้
บทที่ตัวละครหลักในเรื่องจะมีความสุข
คุระโมจิก็จะกลับเข้ามาในชีวิตเพื่อสร้างเรื่องแย่ๆให้อีก
ดีก็ดีไม่สุด เลวก็เลวไม่สุด

สุดท้ายแล้ว ชะตาชีวิตของคนที่ถูกคุระโมจิควบคุม
ก็อาจไม่ใช่แค่ตัวละครในหนังสือเล่มนี้

ก็อาจถูกคุระโมจิควบคุมอยู่เช่นกัน

這才是我喜歡的東野圭吾！雖然手上的書是2019年出版，確認過發現果然是在2003年左右的作品

原本是牙醫家少爺的田島，家中卻遭遇變故導致他遭受霸凌、淪為貧窮、讀不起私立也沒辦法找到好工作的底層。

倉持一再出現，讓他陷入一個又一個新的困境⋯⋯

這本書看到中間突然覺得很煩⚠️因為主角的個性，說穿了就是那種始終被捏著鼻子走的濫好人，讓人覺得他所遇到的事情也都算是自作自受罷了；而他明明知道倉持的不老實，卻一而再再而三相信他的說詞。

但老實說這也是此書寫實的一部分！我覺得社會真的就是像這樣，明明知道某件事情、某個人不好，卻又因為眼前的利益局勢放縱自己沈迷在其中（講個可能有點傷人的例子，不少家暴受害者都會原諒加害人而回到原本的循環，忘了哪本書上看到的）

review_2111284854,ECHO,"Sep 02, 2017",人的恶意可以有多持久？仓持用行动展现得淋漓尽致。作为“弃子”的和幸长大后的智商简直感人。既然智商不够，还傻乎乎不快点逃走，一次次重新被忽悠被操控。一次被骗可以说是天真，N次被骗就是蠢。蠢也就算了，还学人家“出轨”…简直要跪。开始还是怒其不争哀其不幸，后期完全看他怎么自己蠢死。和恶意相比，杀人之门的恶意展示更直白。就是见不得你比我好什么居然可以延续这么长时间……,5,0 likes,74

review_1516259519,Kate,"Jan 18, 2016","This is a book filled with malice. It is undelightful for me to read, for the obvious evil, vicious intentions have reminded me of something I tried hard to forget. It's not a typical detective story, because the murderer and victims are the main charactor. But those twisted feelings, the darkside of human beings in this book kept people drowning, reading, painfully till the end.",4,0 likes,74

Strangely, there are a lot of characters that are just introduced after each chapter in the first part of the book. This is a strange tale of murder X sci-fi that sort of works, and doesn't go down the path of Beautiful Weapon. Not too bad of an ending, rather poignant.",3,0 likes,75

To be honest I can barely remember what I read. It wasn't very memorable. I remember it was about a bunch of university students/graduates who have no idea what they want in life and just loiter all day. The whole atmosphere in the book was depressing and slow, as the shotengai was in decline and businesses were closing down, and the main characters were feeling directionless and unambitious after university. The book itself was alright, not bad, not good. I remember I didn't like those motivational pep talk parts in the book telling people to have hopes and goals and whatnot.

ในเมื่อคดีคลี่คลาย ผู้ร้ายถูกจับ เรื่องก็เหมือนจะจบลงแล้ว แต่ตำรวจ และผู้เกี่ยวข้องในคดีไม่ว่าจะเป็นลูกชายผู้ก่อเหตุ แม้กระทั่งลูกสาวของเหยื่อยังไม่คลายข้อสงสัย ต่างฝ่ายจึงต่างพยายามสืบหาความจริง

อ่านจบแล้วหูยยยยย อะไรจะดราม่า หักมุม 18 ตลบกันขนาดนี้ คดีนี้มีอะไรซับซ้อนกว่าที่ผู้ต้องสงสัยสารภาพไปตั้งแต่ตอนต้นเรื่อง เยอะ มากกกก ก.ไก่ล้านตัว สมกับที่อ.เคโงะเคลมไว้ที่ปกหลังว่า ""สิ่งที่ท้าทายต่อจากนี้ คือจะเขียนให้สนุกกว่าเล่มนี้ได้อย่างไร"" เล่ามากกว่านี้ก็ไม่ได้เดี๋ยวจะสปอย เอาเป็นว่าต้องอ่านเอง รับรองว่าตีลังอ่านก็ยังเดาทิศของคดีไม่ออกเลย

The detective story was so nicely written with an unexpected plot at the end. I was a bit surprised when the “killer” confessed in the first one-third of the story. Moreover, the moral discussion was complicated yet very inspiring. Higashino is always good at asking his readers to think about certain social issues. Highly recommend this book to you.",5,0 likes,77

单板滑雪很有趣，这是事实，但有趣不是全部，世界上比滑雪有趣的事情多了去了。
我觉得让我入迷的，是“进步”。

老实说，我是奔五的大叔，不折不扣的中年，到了这个年纪，学习新鲜事物进而不断进步的机会少之又少，反倒是早年掌握的技能慢慢退化的情况比较多。所以，不管是多小的事情，“昨天不会，今天会了”的感觉总令我欣喜不已。",4,0 likes,78

Even Higashino admitted it in the foreword. Talking about how he wasn’t satisfied with these stories, so that’s why they were never published in the first place. But the warm-hearted editor of him insisted on publishing them because of his fan base. So he gave in and we got this book. Read my full review on my blog :)

review_3862224024,Thanawat,"Mar 05, 2021","ในโลกใบนี้หมอที่ดีก็มีอยู่มาก หมอที่แย่ก็มีเช่นกัน
แต่นิยายเล่มนี้ของ Keigo ได้ฉายภาพที่ยอดเยี่ยมของหมอที่ดีให้กับสังคมได้รับรู้

นิยายขนาดกระทัดรัด สัญชาติญี่ปุ่นฝีมือมหาเทพ Keigo เล่มนี้เปิดเรื่องด้วยความคลางแคลงใจของแพทย์ฝึกหัดสาวผู้สูญเสียพ่อไปจากการผ่าตัดหัวใจชนิดแก้ไขหลอดเลือดแดงใหญ่โป่งพอง (thoracic aortic aneurysm) จึงมุ่งมั่นที่จะเป็นหมอผ่าตัด ด้วยแรงจูงใจที่เกินกว่าใครจะนึกถึง นั่นคือเพื่อที่จะได้รู้ว่าหมอที่ทำผ่าตัดพ่อให้ในอดีตนั้น ทำผิดพลาดจนพ่อของตัวเองเสียชีวิตหรือไม่

Conflict ยังไม่ได้เรียบง่ายเพียงเท่านั้น เพราะหมอผู้ผ่าตัดพ่อในอดีต ในปัจจุบันเป็นอาจารย์ของเธอ และที่หนักไปกว่านั้น หมอคนนั้นยังมีความสัมพันธ์ที่ลึกซึ้งกับแม่ของเธอจนกระทั่งจะกำลังจะดำเนินไปถึงขั้นที่จะแต่งงานกัน กลายเป็นพ่อคนที่สอง เธอต้องอดทนแบกรับความรู้สึกคลางแคลงใจเอาไว้ตั้งแต่วันแรกที่เข้าเรียนแพทย์ มันยากมากที่จะวางใจ เพราะเธอสงสัยมาตลอดว่าอาจารย์ “จงใจ” ผ่าตัดผิดพลาด

ดราม่าชีวิตขั้นหนักดำเนินควบคู่ไปกับการขู่วางแผนก่อวินาศกรรมโรงพยาบาลแห่งเดียวกันนี้ ที่เธอกับอาจารย์แพทย์ทำงานอยู่ โดยผู้ร้ายข่มขู่โดยอาศัยเอาผู้ป่วยเป็นตัวประกันในการล้างแค้นความเจ็บปวดจากการสูญเสียในอดีต

การผ่าตัดที่เรียกว่าการผ่าตัดแบบเปิดหัวใจ (open heart surgery) จำเป็นต้องใช้อุปกรณ์ช่วยหลายอย่างทั้งการดมยาสลบการควบคุมการหายใจและสัญญาณชีพที่ซับซ้อนยิ่งไปกว่านั้นยังต้องทำให้หัวใจหยุดทำงานเป็นชั่วระยะหนึ่งระหว่างที่ผ่าตัด และใช้เครื่องหัวใจและปอดเทียม (heart lung machine) มาพยุงสัญญาณชีพเอาไว้ และไม่ใช้แค่นั้น เพราะหลังจากผ่าตัดเสร็จยังต้องกระตุ้นให้หัวใจกลับมาทำงานถ้ามีข้อผิดพลาดที่ขั้นตอนใดขั้นตอนหนึ่งคนไข้อาจจะเสียชีวิตโดยที่ไม่ได้มีโอกาสรับรู้เลยด้วยซ้ำว่าตัวเองตายไปแล้ว ซึ่งการผ่าตัดนี้แหละที่มามีส่วนเกี่ยวข้องใน conflict ของเรื่อง

เรื่องดำเนินเนิบนาบไม่หวือหวา แต่ดราม่าเข้มข้นตามสไตล์ Keigo
Keigo ยังคงทำการบ้านมาดีมากในการบรรยายรายละเอียดเชิงเทคนิกต่างๆ รวมทั้งการเล่นกับประเด็นทางสังคมอย่างเรื่อง ทุรเวชปฏิบัติ (malpractice) ที่มีเส้นคั่นบางๆ ตัดสินกันด้วย “เจตนา” ล้วนๆ
ท้ายที่สุด การคลาย conflict และคลายปมดราม่า ช่างบีบคั้นหัวใจจนกระตุ้นน้ำตาให้รื้นขึ้นมา

ถูกตรึงไว้กับเวทย์มนตร์ของ Keigo ￼เช่นเคย
ผมชอบมากเพราะ Keigo balance ทั้งฝ่ายผู้เสียหายและฝ่ายหมอได้ดีมาก จนคุณเข้าอกเข้าใจ (empathy) ทั้งสองฝ่าย และคุณจะโกรธฝ่ายใดฝ่ายนึงไม่ลงกรอก

review_3862194929,Mr. N,"Mar 11, 2021",เป็นเรื่องที่ทรงคุณค่าอีกหนึ่งเล่มที่ควรอ่าน เรื่องราวมีความชวนคิดตาม และน่าสงสัยในการกระทำบางอย่างของตัวละคร แถมป๋าได้ตีแผ่ประเด็นของวงการแพทย์ในเรื่อง 'โรคหลอดเลือดแดงใหญ่โป่งพอง' ได้อย่างละเอียดให้ผู้อ่านได้เข้าใจแบบง่ายๆ และพอได้อ่านเรื่องนี้เหมือนได้เข้าใจคำว่า 'หน้าที่' กับ 'นาทีชีวิต' อย่างลึกซึ้งจริงๆ ถือว่าแปลชื่อภาษาไทยออกมาได้ตรงจุดมาก สองคำนี้มันตีความได้ทั้งฝั่งของผู้เป็นแพทย์ และฝั่งของผู้เป็นตำรวจได้ลงตัวสุดๆ บทสรุปสุดท้ายต้องบอกว่าน้ำตาคลอ มันดีจนบรรทัดสุดท้ายจริงๆ ครับ,4,8 likes,80
review_3885672505,Mook Woramon,"Mar 11, 2021","นับว่าเป็นนิยายดราม่าที่สะท้อนเรื่องราวระหว่างคนไข้และแพทย์ได้อย่างดี

แพทย์และคนไข้ไม่ได้ยืนอยู่คนละมุม แต่จริงๆแล้วอุปสรรคคือความไม่รู้ ความไม่รู้ทำให้เกิดความไม่เข้าใจและเพิ่มระยะห่างระหว่างกัน ญาติและคนไข้ไม่รู้ว่าโรคของตัวเองอาการรุนแรงแค่ไหน การรักษาจะมีประโยชน์และโทษอย่างไรบ้าง แพทย์มีหน้าที่บอกเล่าให้เข้าใจถึงอาการนั้นๆ แต่บางครั้งต่อให้ฟังคำอธิบายยังไงก็ยากที่จะเข้าใจได้ถ่องแท้ เมื่อไม่เป็นไปตามคาดหวังไว้ จึงมีโอกาสที่จะผิดใจกันได้ง่าย

คุณเคโงะทำให้เราได้เห็นถึงมุมมองของทั้งแพทย์และคนไข้ ผ่านทางยูกิที่ไปเรียนแพทย์ต่อเพราะข้องใจว่าหมอผ่าตัดอาจไม่ได้รักษาพ่อตัวเองอย่างเต็มที่ โดยตัวยูกิเองมีสถานะเป็นทั้งแพทย์และญาติคนไข้ เมื่อยูกิมาเป็นแพทย์ฝึกหัดและได้ทำงานกับแพทย์ผ่าตัดคนนั้น เธอจึงได้เข้าใจอย่างแท้จริงว่าไม่มีทางที่แพทย์จะตั้งใจปล่อยให้คนไข้เสียชีวิตเป็นอันขาด

""หากหมอทำให้คนไข้ตาย จะเสียใจยิ่งกว่าญาติคนไข้และหมดกำลังใจ สิ่งที่ช่วยให้ยืนหยัดขึ้นมาได้คือการทบทวนอย่างมีสติว่าตัวเองทำอะไรลงไป หากไม่ทำแบบนั้นแล้วไปเผชิญหน้าคนไข้รายต่อไป ก็มีแต่จะถูกความวิตกทำร้าย ต่อให้ผลการรักษาจบลงด้วยความเศร้าแค่ไหน ก็ต้องทำใจเชื่อว่าตัวเองทำดีที่สุดแล้ว ซึ่งมันเป็นสิ่งค้ำจุนให้รักษาคนไข้ต่อไป"" หน้า 133

โดยปกติไม่มีใครที่จู่ๆอยากทำให้คนที่ไม่รู้จักกันตาย หมอที่ปกติก็เช่นกัน (เนื่องจากทุกวงการมีคนที่ไม่ปกติอันนั้นข้อยกเว้น) เมื่อคนไข้ตาย จะว่าหมอเสียใจกว่าญาติคนไข้ก็คงไม่ได้ ความเสียใจมันคนละรูปแบบ ความเสียใจของหมอมันปนความรู้สึกผิดและความกังขาว่าหมอเองทำดีที่สุดหรือยัง ถ้าทบทวนแล้วว่าทำดีที่สุดในสถานการณ์ตอนนั้น ก็ต้องยอมรับและทำใจ เดินหน้าต่อไปให้ได้",4,15 likes,80

review_3915225085,nananatte,"Mar 29, 2021","ชีวิตอดหลับอดนอน สุดอึดสู้งานของแพทย์หญิงฝึกหัดในแผนกศัลยกรรมหลอดเลือดหัวใจ นอกจากจะไม่ได้รับการยอมรับในฐานะหมอ ทั้งจากพยาบาล คนไข้ หรือกระทั่งหมอด้วยกันแล้ว(มาเรียนรู้ฝึกงาน ไม่ใช่หมอประจำ) ยังต้องมาเจอดราม่าในโรงพยาบาล มองดูพยาบาลแบ่งฝักแบ่งฝ่ายจิกกัดกันไปมา

นางเอกของเราเป็นแพทย์ฝึกหัดที่ถูกเรียกเป็น 'คุณหนู' เพราะยังอดนอนยืนทำงานต่อเนื่องข้ามคืนในห้องผ่าตัดไม่ได้ เรื่องมีวูบไปบ้างหรือหลับถึงเช้าในห้องพักแพทย์ ก็รู้หมดทั้งแผนก เรียกว่าโดนสายตาตำหนิจากแพทย์ผู้ใหญ่ครบ

เหนื่อยกับการเรียน+ทำงานแล้ว ก็ยังมีเรื่องเข้ากับแม่ไม่ได้อีก เธอรู้สึกว่าถูกแม่หักหลัง โทรศัพท์หากันน้อยลงทุกที ครั้งหลังสุดที่เจอกันก็จำไม่ได้แล้วว่าคือเมื่อไร

เหตุที่คุณนางเอกเลือกเรียนหมอ เพราะเธอสงสัยว่า การตายของพ่อตัวเองไม่น่าใช่การตายตามปกติ แต่เป็นเพราะหมอที่ผ่าตัดเส้นเลือดหัวใจให้พ่อเธอจงใจผ่าตัดผิดพลาด

และหมอคนที่ว่า
คือคนที่อยู่ตรงหน้า
คืออาจารย์หมอของเธอเอง

'หน้าที่กับนาทีชีวิต' เป็นการอ่านงานคุณเคโงะที่ไม่ค่อยเหมือนงานคุณเคโงะสักเท่าไร เพราะเนื้อเรื่องเรียบนิ่งต่อเนื่องจนถึง 3/5 ของเล่ม กราฟอารมณ์เริ่มจะมาพุ่งทะยานก็ตอน 2/5 สุดท้าย ถึงจะตัดฉึบฉับตื่นเต้นช็อตต่อช็อต และจบสวยรอบทิศทาง

ถ้าดูแค่ปก ก็คงเข้าใจว่า เป็นนิยายเกี่ยวกับหมอ ซึ่งพูดแบบนั้นก็ถูก เพราะเนื้อเรื่องเผยชีวิตหมอกับพยาบาล ทั้งชีวิตในและนอกรพ.

หมอก็คน พยาบาลก็คน ห้องรกก็ดี ครอบครัวยุ่งเหยิงก็ดี ชีวิตรักงงๆ ก็ดี สุดท้าย ทุกคนก็เป็นคนธรรมดา มีเลือดมีเนื้อ เจ็บเป็น ท้อเป็น สับสนเป็น

ถึงจะเพิ่งเผชิญความเป็นความตายมาหมาดๆ แต่ทั้งหมอกับพยาบาลก็ยังเก็บอาการและดูแลผู้ป่วยและญาติรายอื่นๆ ต่อไป ้พราะนั่นคือ 'หน้าที่'ที่พวกเขาเลือกแล้ว

ความน่าสนใจของเล่มนี้ คือ การทำความเข้าใจว่า ความผิดพลาดทางการแพทย์คืออะไรกันแน่?

ความผิดพลาดทางการแพทย์ เป็นสิ่งที่คนไข้และญาติ ไม่มีทางรู้หรือเข้าใจได้อยู่แล้ว หากหมอและรพ.เจตนาจะปกปิด ยังไงคนทั่วไปก็ไม่เข้าใจสภาวะหรือค่าตัวเลขยากๆ พวกนั้นอยู่แล้ว

เนื้อหาในเล่ม แสดงให้เห็นว่า สิ่งที่หมอมอง กับสิ่งที่คนไข้มองว่าเป็น 'ความผิดพลาดในการรักษา' มันไม่เหมือนกัน

ความเข้าใจจากสองมุมมองนี้มันไม่ตรงกัน เรื่องอาจไปจบลงที่ศาล ที่การเรียกร้อง การแก้แค้น หรือจบลงตรงที่สามารถทำให้ครอบครัวผู้เสียชีวิตเข้าใจก็ได้

ประเด็นของเล่มคือการเล่นกับ 'หน้าที่'

และพอเล่นเรื่องนี้ มันจึงไม่ใช่แค่เรื่องหมอกับพยาบาล แต่มันมีการตั้งคำถามถึง 'หน้าที่' ของตัวละครในเรื่อง ซึ่งรวมถึงทั้งตำรวจและประธานบริษัท

และก็ชวนให้ย้อนสงสัยว่า เราเอง... ได้ทำ 'หน้าที่' ของตัวเองแล้วรึยัง?

จุดหนึ่งที่เราว่าน่าเสียดาย คือ
ในเล่มไม่ได้พูดถึงหน้าที่ความรับผิดชอบของท่านประธานบริษัทมากนัก

ทั้งหมดที่พูด เป็นมุมมองของคนอื่นที่มีต่อท่านประธาน มากกว่าจะเป็นการแสดงออกจากตัวแกเอง ทำให้เรื่องเบาไป และไม่ได้แสดงความเป็นมนุษย์ของตัวละครตัวนี้

แต่เราคิดว่า ใครเป็นตำรวจ หมอ หรือพยาบาลอ่านคงชอบใจ เพราะเรื่องนี้นี่จบแบบฮีโร่มากๆ เลยล่ะค่ะ

ช่วงแรกถึงกลางเรื่องสำหรับเราค่อนข้างเอื่อยมากเลยค่ะ แต่พอถึงช่วงท้ายๆ แล้วพลิกหน้าต่อหน้าเลย รู้สึกเครียด กดดันตามตัวละครแต่ละครตัวเลยค่ะ เขียนได้เก่งจริงๆ

แต่เราว่าเล่มนี้แตะประเด็นของแต่ละตัวละครตื้นไปหน่อย ความรู้สึกภายในจิตใจยังถูกสื่อออกมาได้ไม่มากขนาดนั้น แรงจูงใจของแพทย์ฝึกหัดหรือตัวคนร้ายดูไม่ค่อย make sense เท่าไหร่ด้วย

** Spoil Alert **
เราว่าตอนจบจบง่ายไปด้วยค่ะ แถมเราว่าจบเบียวไปนิดนึงด้วย55555 ทนเรียนแพทย์มาตั้ง 6-7 ปี ยอมรับง่ายเพราะแค่คำอธิบายนิดหน่อยกับเข้าไปช่วยผ่าตัดเลยหรอ แถมคนร้ายก็จบง่ายเกิน แต่อย่างว่าอะนะคนร้ายมี empathy

ปมของยูกิคือ พ่อตายหลังผ่าตัดหลอดเลือดแดงใหญ่ส่วนโค้งโป่งพอง โดยมีอาจารย์นิชิโซโนะเป็นคนลงมีด อาจารย์คนเดียวกับที่กำลังสอนนางเอกและกำลังจะเป็นพ่อคนที่สองด้วย ยูกิเลยสงสัยมาตลอดว่าที่พ่อตาย อาจารย์นิชิโซโนะกับแม่จงใจให้เกิดขึ้นรึเปล่า

ปมของการเปิดเผยความผิดพลาดทางการแพทย์ เล่ามากไม่ได้เด๋วสปอย เหตุการณ์ต่างๆเป็นตัวดำเนินเรื่อง มีตำรวจชื่อ นานาโอะ เป็นคนตามสืบหาข้อมูล คนร้ายมีปมที่วางแผนให้เกิดเรื่องนี้

ตอนที่เรื่องเริ่มเฉลยเหตุผลต่างๆ คิดว่านักเขียนเก่งมากๆที่ทำให้เราเข้าใจความรู้สึกของตัวละครแต่ละตัว จนคลี่คลายจบตอนสุดท้าย มันมีแต่เหตุผลว่าทำไมการผ่าตัดครั้งที่ต้องทำให้สำเร็จ เชื่อมโยงกับชื่อหนังสือที่คำว่า หน้าที่ แล้วเรื่องเกี่ยวกับการแพทย์เขียนมาละเอียดจนนึกภาพตามได้เลยเหมือนกำลังดูหนังเลยอ่ะ

review_3865997789,Kurogirl,"Mar 06, 2021","** spoiler alert ** ปมของเรื่องอยู่ที่ปมของแพทย์หญิง กับปมของคนร้าย

ปมของแพทย์หญิง คือ บอกตามตรงว่ารู้สึกหงุดหงิด มีความไม่ไว้ใจเพื่อนร่วมงาน แล้วจะทำงานอยู่ด้วยกันได้ยังไง

ส่วนปมของคนร้ายนี่ก็ไม่ต่างกัน เป็นคนร้ายที่เลวมาก เพราะอยากจะโจมตีรพ. คนไข้คนอื่นเขาไม่ได้ทำอะไรให้เลย ถ้าอยากฆ่าใครก็ลงมือเอง จะมายืมมือหมอทำไม ทำไมคนอื่นเสี่ยงด้วยทำไม โกรธมากกก

ที่จริงช่วงท้ายคือดีมาก ลุ้นกับการผ่าตัดและสนุกมาก ปมก็แก้ได้ คนร้ายก็ถือว่ายังมีความเป็นคนเหลืออยู่บ้าง ส่วนคุณหมอก็คิดได้สักที อยากให้ทุกคนได้อ่านแล้วจะรู้ว่าการจะช่วยชีวิตของคนคนหนึ่งมีกี่คนที่ได้พยายามบ้าง และเขาพยายามกันแค่ไหน",0,0 likes,80

review_4397168743,Tantannn,"Dec 19, 2021","นอกจากประเด็นหลักทีนำเสนอได้คงเส้นคงวาตลอดทั้งเล่ม เราสนใจสายตาของ Keigo ที่มองคนได้อย่างกลมมากๆ เก็บรายละเอียดการทำงานของจิตใจในชั่วขณะเล็ก ๆ ที่มีความลังเล ความแน่วแน่ได้ทุกเม็ด

การเดินเรื่องกำลังสนุก แต่ยังอาศัยจังหวะ coincidental ในการเชื่อมต่อเรื่องทำให้อดคิดไม่ได้ว่าจะบังเอิญไปมั้ย ตอนท้ายเรื่องมีการคลายปมในใจตัวละครตัวหนึ่ง แต่สำหรับเรา ไม่มีอะไรหวือหวา + คิดตลอดว่า ถ้าการกระทำที่ใช้พิสูจน์ความเป็นคนน่ายกย่องและเพื่อคลายปมตัวละครอีกตัว แท้จริงแล้วเป็นเพียงการจัดฉากได้มั้ย มันจะน่าเชื่อถือแค่ไหนกัน? (ส่วนตัวไม่ buy ขนาดนั้น ยังคิดว่ามีมุมให้ตั้งคำถามได้อีกมาก)

ในเชิงข้อมูล รายละเอียดเรื่องวิศวกรรมน่าจะเป็นของถนัดจากแบ็คกราวน์ แต่ข้อมูลการแพทย์ต่างๆ แสดงให้เห็นว่าผู้เขียนทำงานหนักมากจริงๆ คารวะจากใจ

不過，書中還是有一點令我感到有趣的，就是東野老師是本書的主角，他在書中不時提及一些自己的其他著作或相關的花邊，比如說他在改編自他的小說《綁架遊戲》的電影開拍發報會前夕因滑雪受傷了，當時劇中的主角藤木直人及仲間由紀惠吃驚不少之類的趣聞軼事。",3,0 likes,92
