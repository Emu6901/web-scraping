review_2500243336,Joanne,"Aug 23, 2018","Brilliant, it’s been awhile since I gave a 5⭐️ Rating but this book is deservingly so. Fabulous, had me hook from start to finish. I loved the approach by the author. This isn’t your typical who done it. From the start you know who and how but keep reading cause it’s just the tip,of the iceberg and all will be revealed in the most unexpected way, totally blew me away. 👏👏👏👏👏👏👍👍👍😎 btw the ending —HEARTBREAKING!",5,10 likes,1
review_1877877075,Pavel Sikora,"Jan 13, 2017","I liked the concept of us—the readers—watching both sides (the “bad guys” as well as the “good guys”), not really being able to decide who do we want to win. It didn't really matter that we knew from the start what had happened (or did we?). However, even if the book was a nice read, to say Keigo Higashino is the “Japanese Stieg Larsson” is—I think—a bit too bold.",3,1 like,1
review_2384696108,Jiwoo Kim,"May 07, 2018","The Devotion of Suspect X is a detective fiction book by Keigo Higashino. I like this book because it is different from the other detective fiction book. The normal detective fiction books are the reader read the story about the person who follows the suspect or the suspect, but this book is the reader read the story about the person close to the suspect. The story is focused on the suspect's side. The three reasons why I can focus on the book more than the other books that I read before are the simile, mood, and foreshadowing that the author used in the book. The first thing that I like about this book is the simile. The author use simile to create mood, which the second thing that I like about in the book. In the book, “The man looked around the shop, both hands thrust into the pockets of his dark navy windbreaker, like a prospective customer trying to figure out what he should buy”. In this sentence, the author use simile to create the mood of the man. Example for the foreshadowing is this, “She had only recently learned that he taught math when she happened to notice outside his apartment door a bundle of old math textbooks, wrapped in string and awaiting disposal”. This means that Ishigami is smart enough to teach math and this will go to affect her. I recommend this book to the young adult age people and adults because this book is complicated for the young age. Or I recommend this book to the people who want to try another style of detective noble.",4,0 likes,1
