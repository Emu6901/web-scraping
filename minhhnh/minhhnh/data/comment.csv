review_2384696108,Jiwoo Kim,"May 07, 2018","The Devotion of Suspect X is a detective fiction book by Keigo Higashino. I like this book because it is different from the other detective fiction book. The normal detective fiction books are the reader read the story about the person who follows the suspect or the suspect, but this book is the reader read the story about the person close to the suspect. The story is focused on the suspect's side. The three reasons why I can focus on the book more than the other books that I read before are the simile, mood, and foreshadowing that the author used in the book. The first thing that I like about this book is the simile. The author use simile to create mood, which the second thing that I like about in the book. In the book, ‚ÄúThe man looked around the shop, both hands thrust into the pockets of his dark navy windbreaker, like a prospective customer trying to figure out what he should buy‚Äù. In this sentence, the author use simile to create the mood of the man. Example for the foreshadowing is this, ‚ÄúShe had only recently learned that he taught math when she happened to notice outside his apartment door a bundle of old math textbooks, wrapped in string and awaiting disposal‚Äù. This means that Ishigami is smart enough to teach math and this will go to affect her. I recommend this book to the young adult age people and adults because this book is complicated for the young age. Or I recommend this book to the people who want to try another style of detective noble.",4,0 likes,1

Yasuko and her daughter, Misato, killed the husband/father. Then, their neighbor, Ishigami, calls and offers to help them bury the body.
How'd he know?
Well, it's Ishigami‚Äôs brilliant cover-up that drives the story forward! OMGosh! Brilliant writing!
Anyway, Detective Kusanagi of the Edogawa police and his friend, Yukawa, a friend and a genius who sometimes helps the police, battle to find the truth surrounding Togashi‚Äôs murder.
The truth they try to prove is that Yasuko's story is a lie.
We readers see fragments of Ishigami‚Äôs plan... At first it seems simplistic; even sort of careless. However, we discover all too soon it's actually quite a deceptive plan and it's pretty complex.
Oh, yeah, Ishigami is a mathematical genius and he's a logical thinker and even tells mother and daughter that logic will get them through everything... yes, he actually applies math ideas to their problem like in that TV series ""Numb3rs"".

Soon a leeter was dropped in the store seeking store owner's advice about some dilemma that a young woman was facing at that time in her life. Thieves after a heated discussion decides to help the young woman by answering her questions, thus starting a chain of questions and answers that takes the reader back and forth in time in the life of different people who at some point dropped a letter in the store in search of answers to their questions.

Many characters were introduced throughout the story. Some of their stories left me with teary eyes while others put a smile on my face. Despite many arcs in story everything was tied up neatly in the end making it a very satisfying read for me.

This was truly a heartwarming yet tear-inducing read reminiscent of the quaint magic Studio Ghibli films always have. No one would expect that Keigo Higashino, a resident powerhouse of the Japanese crime fiction genre, would be the genius behind this masterpiece. However, I noticed that all of his books always examine the value of filial love and have a heartfelt theme despite the fact that the story centers on a murder.

The Miracles of the Namiya General Store follows this theme as well and At times, I was frustrated with the three delinquents' brash ignorance and I wished that their personal stories were also examined more. However, they had developed by the end quite well and I was really touched with their reflections brought by the magic pervading in the store.

I really felt elated and full of love while reading this book! This is by far one of my favorite pieces from Keigo Higashino, and I'm now sure of the fact that he's my favorite author of the year.

P.S. There's also a movie released in 2017 so I'm off to watch it now and cry all over again HAHAHA.

~ Quick Summary ~

Three delinquents hide out in an old abandoned general store where they exchange letters with people from the past who are seeking life advice and unexpectedly become life coaches üòÜ.

~ Pick this up if you enjoy/don‚Äôt mind ~

‚ú® Magic Realism

üò¢ Emotional and touching stories

üê¢ Slower pace

üòÜ Some comedy

üìö ""the Housekeeper and the Professor‚Äù (I definitely enjoyed Namiya more!!)

~ What I loved ~

I loved the use of different POV and timelines because of how they connected. First we were introduced to the delinquents who stumbled upon the magical store and their first letter. I was disappointed when we changed POV but seeing the letter and from a different perspective was actually quite hilarious because it was so brutally honest and I could imagine the delinquents blabbering about what to write.

This was very touching. The people seeking advice were normal, everyday people so they were relatable and it was easy to connect. The lessons that the characters learned were actually so amazing and touching. There were 3 moments that made me unexpectedly emotional. I even cried and that is rare!

~ What I didn‚Äôt enjoy ~

The stories were a little boring to begin with, but when the characters learn, develop and think about the advice, it does get interesting and tug at the heartstrings. As there are quite a few stories in there, we have to go back to the beginning to introduce the characters and their stories. So going through that process multiple times does slow down the pace for me.",4,74 likes,2

what it actually is:-


unapologetically Japanese, beautifully crafted, and heartbreakingly uplifting‚Äî the miracles of the namiya general store is a miraculous piece of art and it probably deserves a little more love and appreciation than what its already getting.

people don‚Äôt drift apart for one specific reason. well, you might be able to find a reason, but you could come up with one only after you made up your mind, a tired excuse tacked on after the fact.



while i'm mourning all that's been lost in translation, i'm still feeling hopeful and would recommend this book to anyone wanting to hear the stories that this book tells. it, my friend, is a story of some boys next door, of an athlete, of that one golden hearted and talented musician, it's a story of an orphanage, it also happens to be a story of a love, and most of all a story made up with words that were left unsaid, it' s a story of many people that i, unfortunately, will never have the privilege to meet. im never going to meet namiya, i will never get any piece of advice from him, but maybe i can be the namiya is someone else's life, who knows?


anyways, a few realization‚§µ

‚ûúit's you who changes your life, it's you who has to get up from your bed in the morning, and deal with the world. and you do have control over almost everything in your life.
‚ûúeveryone needs advice, but at the end of the day the answer lies in your heart. you already know the solution, you just need someone to show you the path sometimes. and it's okay to seek help.
‚ûúevery decision we take, make makes us us
‚ûúwe all are, as human beings, somehow connected.





lastly, all my friends loved this book a little bit more than i did. i can tell its mostly me, not the book. i'm not a huge fan of magical realism aspect in contemporary fiction and the time jump is something that easily manages to give me headaches. also the writing put me off. but i dont regret giving it a try. it was worth it.",3,46 likes,2

Buddy read with Chaity, Sinthia, Rajeswari and Maliha. üíñüíñ

‚ÄúPeople don't drift apart for one specific reason. Well, you might be able to find a reason, but you could come up with one only after you made up your mind, a tired excuse tacked on after the fact. If their hearts were still in it and their bond was threatening to sever, you'd think one of them would step in and try to fix things. When no one does, you you know the bond has already been broken.‚Äù


The Plot: Atsuya, Koehi and Shota - three really close friends are currently on a run. They have done something very wrong. They just robbed a woman.Trying to find the perfect to hide, they come across to an old abandoned house. To be more specific a decades old general store- The Namiya General Store. They take shelter there for a night. But they never imagined that this ""one night"" will change their whole lives.

This deeply moving story follows several different characters across decades in time, all of them linked by a magical little place; a general store called ""The Namiya General Store"". A old named Mr. Yuji Namiya is the owner of this store. He‚Äôs a man living the last phase of his life. His wife has passed away and he decides on a whim to give written advice to correspondents. So, he starts accepting handwritten letters from anyone who has a question to ask and try his earnest to give them the right replies and advices. That's how this incredible journey of the Namiya General Store begins......

‚óá I loved:

*The writing: I really loved the easy and accessible writing of this book. It was very simple yet elegant. I just flew through the writing. The translation was amazing.

*The characters: This book features a huge cast of diverse characters. The author has beautifully portrayed all of these characters. Loved how the story is told from different perspectives across the time. All of the characters belong to different times and places. So, their way of thinking, their conflicts and decisions weren't similar. That's what made everything seem so real. All of the characters are inter-connected and the common connection they have is the Namiya General Store. I liked the characters cast a lot. The only problem I faced with it was that I couldn't remember their names. There are lots of names and I kept forgetting them. This somehow affected my reading experience. As I told you, all the characters are inter-related. So, It's for the best to remember them all. And I couldn't. I just couldn't memorize who is who. By the way, the aspiring musician was my favourite character. Loved Sota too.

*The letters: The letters were life. Okay? I absolutely adored all these different types of letters. The author weaves an intertwining tapestry of human relationships that transcends time. I highly admired the way the author sewed all these broken promises and conflicted hearts together and crafted this masterpiece of a book.

*Others: ""The Miracles of the Namiya General Store"" is a heart breaking tale of humanity, finding ones true self, our conflicts, the decisions we make and how a single piece of word can change our lives. Mr. Namiya started a wonderful job and the three boys finished it.

‚óá Cons: The main problem I had with the book is the time jumps. They were bit too much. The jumps between time and places confused me. For a moment, we are here in the 21st century and then, suddenly we are in the 80s. Well, that felt kinda under whelming.

‚ÄúBe a fighter. Give it everything you‚Äôve got. Even a losing battle is worth fighting. Go out and make your mark.‚Äù


Despite having a con or two, this book is a must read for everyone. I devoured it. I really liked it and enjoyed the whole time reading it. Now, I am really really interested in checking out more books by Japanese authors.

I wish there were a Namiya General Store everywhere around the world. If not so, just one person like Yuji Namiya, who'd take even pranks seriously.

This book was heart melting. It felt like a warm hug across time. It made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me nostalgic, it made me believe in miracles.

If this book had nothing but those letters, sent through the mail slot and answered in the milk crate, it'd still be a wonderful book. But the author gave every letter a story and some wonderful characters. And of course - the miracles, the time travelling of not just the letters, but also lives and emotions.

In the five chapters, we found seven different stories. Five of them were of the seekers of advices, one was of Yuji Namiya himself and another was of the brutal advice givers! Five who sought advices, took them differently. One could only see what she wanted to see. One stuck to the advice untill the very end. One realised the inner meaning and took her decision accordingly. One didn‚Äôt take the advice and the other found some ""premonitions"" unasked.

But the most amazing thing is, all of the stories were interconnected through time and space. The author left no loose threads. He woved them all together and created this outstanding piece of literature.",5,17 likes,2

So they start answering them, rather less tactfully.

The stories are nicely interwoven, the time jump aspect nicely worked out, and the way the advice works is fun, as we see people interpreting and reacting to the advice in ways shaped far more by themselves than by the advice givers. Yes, whimsical, bit sentimental, and the translation is rather clunky, but whatever: it's a feel-good book (though with quite a lot of hard things noted about Japan and capitalism and sexism) and the ending is super uplifting and really nicely led up to.

It is about 3 thieves looking for a place to hide on their way to escape from the police. They reach an old house that looks like an old General store and decides to make their way in, spend the night there, and make their way out in the morning. However, as they look around the house, they realize that there's something going on in this house. Something strange. They receive an envelope in the mailbox outside the store and gets shocked about it since the store seemed like it was closed decades ago, and the text in the mail seemed like it was from the past. The mail was about troubles this woman had and was asking them to help. They decide to reply back, and they soon realize that this store manager from a long time ago helped solve his villager's troubles. As the story goes on, they receive more envelopes and it shows different kinds of trouble different people have and how the 3 thieves reply back. This story is very interesting because it goes through the past and present times and how the thieves give feedback to those mails are quite funny, too. But at last, it shows heartwarming stories/troubles and big lessons of how they solved those troubles.

This is my lifelong book; also for many Koreans since it's a very well-known book in Korea. If there is an English version of this book, I would definitely recommend it to more elderly people since there are few parts where it may get a little confusing (time lapse between the past and present), and I think it has stories that more elderly people can relate to.

Gradually, they begin to notice that things aren‚Äôt adding up‚Ä¶ the clock on their phones is working strangely, and there‚Äôs an odd aura pervading the space. When a letter drops in through the mail slot requesting advice, they know something is up. Their first instinct is to leave, but ultimately‚Ä¶ they don‚Äôt want to leave the author of the letter unanswered. She is a fencer training for the Olympics, and her boyfriend is struggling with cancer. Although he encourages her to live out their dream for her and keep training as hard as she can, she‚Äôs torn between acceding to his wishes and spending her time supporting him through chemotherapy.

As they correspond with her, they come to an abrupt realization: ‚ÄúMoon Rabbit,‚Äù as she signs her letters, is not from the present. The letters are coming across years to reach them. She‚Äôs confused when they mention the Internet or cell phones, and they ultimately nail down the ‚Äúwhen‚Äù of her time by asking about favorite songs and films. Moon Rabbit is writing to them from 1979‚Ä¶. the year prior to Japan boycotting the Olympics. Armed with this knowledge, the boys give her advice and do their best to dissuade her from pursing her training and encourage her to stay with her partner. This doesn‚Äôt quite work as they intended, but it does ultimately work out for the best.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs an amazing guy. No tricks, no bullshit. I mean, when I told him about my problem, he practically bopped me on the head. But he forced me to figure things out and see that I was getting in my own way. He‚Äôs the reason why I was finally able to stop worrying and throw myself into the training.‚Äù

After they finish their correspondence with Moon Rabbit, another letter drops in. As the novel progresses, it focuses on multiple other points of view so that we seen not only the letters from each of these individuals, but also how they implemented the advice they were given and about their lives back in time.

While I feel that the core conceit of this book was solid, I felt that overall the plot alone wasn‚Äôt enough to justify the slice-of-life nature of this story. Slice of life is very difficult to write well, given that the other elements of the book need to be strong enough to overcome the lack of plot. Characters, atmosphere, and prose are key to a successful novel‚Ä¶ and unfortunately, I found that they did not come through with enough strength for me to be fully drawn in to this book. Given the glowing reviews of this book as it is written in other languages, I suspect part of this may be due to a slightly lackluster translation ‚Äì in the original Japanese, it‚Äôs very possible that the prose is utterly to die for. The English version, unfortunately, leaves a bit to be desired and comes off as dry and slightly simplistic.

All in all, this is a good book to read if you want something that‚Äôs optimistic as well as a quick and easy read. It‚Äôs friendly, cozy, and extremely accessible. This is probably a better fit for people who tend to read fiction as opposed to fantasy or science fiction, as these elements are somewhat lighter than I might have hoped. The story overall is very grounded in reality and feels more like a parable of sorts rather than the exploration of new ideas I tend to expect from speculative fiction.

Never thought I would be this satisfied after reading a book, this probably one of my best reads this year. I have read 7 books by Keigo Higashino of which on crime thriller and investigation, but The Miracles of the Namiya General Store was totally out of that kind of genre, okay maybe it has a bit of crime in it but this book touches more on humanity and spirits, one's dream that crawls into a parallel universe and intertwined the past and future.

I love how each stories connected and creating a new narrative, on how Yuji Namiya started the miracles-- ""I treat every letter that comes in as a cry for help. These people are no different from the rest of us. They have a hole in their hearts, and something vital is bleeding out. You can't ignore someone who speaks to you from the heart."" The characters were superb-- the three dudes, the musician, the dubious doggy, Paul Lennon also Ms. Moon Rabbit-- they were all my favorite! The story-telling was magnificently inspiring, development and plot transition from each stories were well written, I really enjoyed every bits of it. Love that pinch of The Beatles and few insight of Japan's history.

It was sweet and fantastical, not the usual Keigo Higashino but better. Namiya General Store should continue its service!

""A blank map means you can fill it in however you like. It‚Äôs entirely up to you. Everything is open; the possibilities are limitless. It‚Äôs a beautiful thing. I can only hope this helps you find a way to start believing in yourself.""

""NO MATTER HOW BAD THINGS ARE TODAY, THEY'LL BE FAR BETTER TOMORROW.""
-Namiya General Store.
***** A real 5 star book.
Namiya and nayami, the Japanese word for problems, woes, whatever. If you come by the Namiya General Store in XX city after hours and slip a letter through the mail slot in their shutter, an answer will be waiting for you in the milk crate around back in the morning. By keeping this in front, the Namiya General Store's Mr. Namiya used to answer little childrens letter and gave advices. Advice 'bout life, 'bout studies and everything..... Like that- a que. ""Tell me how I can get an A+ on a test without studying or cheating or anything."" And it's ans. from Mr. Namiya- ""Ask your teacher to test you on yourself. Since you're the topic of the test, whatever you say will be correct."" this really shows, what a person Namiya was!
The book is so much well writtened (and the translation was also WOW!) that many times I felt the deepest infatuation of my heart for the persons of this book. There was different stories in 1st 4 chapters and in the 5th, they all came in the same place . The last (last~est~) reply of the blank letter was really a miracle! The book was like TIME TRAVELLING !
In most time I feel jealous of the Japanese Writers. Now, I need a Namiya General Store! Who will give me a Mr. Namiya....!!!!
Love this than many other books.",5,9 likes,2
review_3435599857,Lauren,"Oct 14, 2021","This book is beautifully written and effortlessly intertwines the various characters‚Äô lives we encounter throughout. There is a completeness to this book which you don‚Äôt find in most other novels and this is why it is such a satisfying read.

I will say I didn‚Äôt love all of the 5 chapters equally and felt that chapter 4 was the weakest. Conversely chapter 2 was the one which affected me the most emotionally and chapter 3 also really stood out to me as a very strong story. There is an affecting poignancy to all of the chapters and characters‚Äô lives and the advice the owner (and later the 3 delinquents give) to ordinary citizens is life-affirming and fundamentally human.

I was touched throughout whilst reading this magical and thought-provoking book and some of the chapters will stay with me for a while to come (including that ending)! *shivers*",4,9 likes,2
review_3460409376,Stephi,"Sep 21, 2020","The Miracles of the Namiya General Store is the heartwarming and magical story of three delinquents who end up in an abandoned general store, where, to their surprise, a request for advice arrives through the mail slot.

""Harassment, pranks, it doesn't matter to me. I treat every letter that comes in as a cry for help. These people are no different from the rest of us. They have a hole in their hearts, and something vital is bleeding out...You can't ignore someone who speaks to you from the heart.""

This book cleverly weaves together the story of all its characters into a complex tapestry of relationships forged throughout time. I loved the detail and nuance in each letter-writer's personal story and background, but wished the three men giving advice were also developed a bit more.

At first, I was annoyed by how harsh and ignorant the men's, and especially Atsuya's, advice was, but I loved their development through the novel as they grew and learned from each correspondent.

review_3076775759,Ian Josh,"Jan 14, 2020","I enjoy Higashino very much, and his last work translated into English (The Newcomer) was of a sweeter variety than his mysteries, but I liked it... but sometimes there‚Äôs just too much.

I enjoyed the setup in this novel. The hints and beginning of something magical. It helped I started just before Christmas and I couldn‚Äôt help but see some comparisons to One Magic Christmas, a film that is arguably too sappy, but also sometimes feels just perfect.

Maybe I should have finished this book by Christmas Eve, before the Magic drifted away? Maybe?

But even taking a chance to relax this holiday season before picking this up to finish in the early days of January can‚Äôt be used as an excuse for what is either weak plotting, or possibly mid-decisions by the translator or his editors.

If the Japanese was this sappy, the English should have had just a little pulled away. Besides that, if Higashino over explained every little nugget, than a strong English editor should have been brave enough to say that this wasn‚Äôt necessary in English.

It‚Äôs fun when something from page 10 connects to something on page 150, but much less so when it‚Äôs pointed out, or screamed out, as it is here.

‚ÄúHey look, look what I did. Isn‚Äôt it smart and cute and sweet? See, this character is connected to that one, and these two are the same person... see, look, don‚Äôt miss it.‚Äù

A little subtlety would have improved this book a lot, and a bit more editing could have grown what began as promising and interesting into a more enjoyable book.

As it is, this is easily the worst of the Higashino books available in English and I can‚Äôt recommend it his fans or fans of sweet magical tales.

A shame, as it feels like it could have been much better, especially with Higashino as the writer.",2,7 likes,2

It was awesome to see how the different stories are all intertwined. The concept was very good and unique as well. It was a jump between past and present all in a single night and it was very interesting.

What fell short was for me the structure of the book. It is divided in different parts but every single one follows the exact same format, repeating the same dynamics over and over again, so unfortunately in the end I got bored.

The characters were okay but they could have been worked out better, they were all a little flat.

So overall it was interesting to see how the story developed and ended but it reaped the same building over and over.",3,8 likes,2

review_3126557730,Reading_ Tamishly,"Jan 07, 2020","Nope. No, this isn't your typical detective-murder-hunt-the-rat book. This is almost a psychological thriller where the answer has been thrown to the reader from the very first page yet it gives the thrill with amazing twists and turns as to why the character did what he did.
The title has been so aptly given. It explains everything! Damn this book is so good. The mathematician genius clashing with his old school mate, another Physics genius. Everything is out there. Nothing much to solve to find who who did the obvious or the reasons behind it. It's the intense character study and presentation that made the book so damn amazing. Yes, shortcomings are there when things tend to fly above your head when these two seemingly geniuses talk about the same things. I don't think it was even necessary. But still....wow...I was wowed...and wowed still.

For a book like this, if I try to write something about the story or the plot it will just ruin everything. So I won't. But I guarantee you it's a very different read with indepth character study and reasons why and what of the event that happened. Ah, the devotion. Seriously, it's all about this devotion.

This book is crazy good madness.",5,119 likes,3
review_2322855571,carol.,"Apr 08, 2018","Both unusual and familiar, The Devotion of Suspect X is an unassuming mystery with an astonishing approach.

It is a book that will toy with the very definition of the concept of 'spoilers:' it begins with a few hours in our main characters' daily routines, then quickly jumps into an emotional scene that results in murder. I admit that I was doubtful; how was I to stay interested in a mystery where I already knew the answers to the 'who-what-where-why-when?' But Hiashino is quite masterful, drawing a veil over the disposition of the body. The reader is left in a unique position of knowing more than the police about where the investigation should end, but discovering clues with the police as they work backwards.

The narrative follows both the police investigation and the viewpoint of the perpetrator(s), leaving me marveling at the chess game. Something in it puts me in mind of Agatha Christie, although it could be that she's just the one I always think of when it comes to non-gory murder and a more nuanced form of suspense. It is a book that is as much about characters and social protocols as much as mystery, but don't let that frighten you away. There's a distinct whiff of literary-fiction about this as well, a story that is also about the everyday lives and the future dreams of the characters.

My complaints are very small; there was a preponderance of characters whose names began with 'K,' and I believe at least two had first and last names with 'K.' A switch from first to last name use depending on who was talking proved initially confusing and left me glad I could flip back a few pages. The ending... sigh. Appropriate, but leaving me ambivalent. The air of melancholy is too strong for me to want to add this to my library, thus the less than 5 stars.

The fact that this was a best-seller in Japan left me bemused. According to the author's GR page, ""The Devotion of Suspect X was the second highest selling book in all of Japan‚Äî fiction or nonfiction‚Äîthe year it was published, with over 800,000 copies sold."" I find this especially interesting when I think of the mysteries thrillers that routinely top American best-seller lists. This is almost the exact opposite kind of story, and for me, a far more fulfilling one. It leaves me curious to check out Higashino's other works.

review_120488544,Irene,"Sep 07, 2010","Not only is THE DEVOTION OF SUSPECT X a multi-faceted cultural reading experience, but it also acutely complements the familiar psychological suspense/thriller/mystery genre by infusing Japanese philosophy. Keigo Higashino shrewdly and subtly induces the reader to contemplate the immeasurable complexities of the human psyche by questioning what motivates one human being to judge who is worthy of life, and who is not.

Tetsuya Ishigami‚Äôs daily schedule is precisely what one would expect of a Japanese mathematics‚Äô teacher. His unsuccessful attempts to motivate visibly bored and apathetic students discourage Ishigami, and his one true passion of solving a complex mathematical formula, lies outside of the classroom within the confines of his small apartment. A barren life carved out of necessity dramatically changes when Yasuko and her daughter Misato introduce themselves as his new neighbors. He imagines a fantasy life with them, listening to mother and daughter through the thin apartment walls, and his daily walk to school includes a stop to purchase his boxed lunch at the small shop where Yasuko works. Within this fictitious context, Ishigami surprisingly exhibits a fierce desire to protect both mother and daughter, and so begins a bizarre tale that originates with the unexpected arrival of Yasuko‚Äôs nefarious ex-husband Togashi.

To divulge the minute intricacies of this suspenseful tale would require *spoilers.* Ishigami‚Äôs masterful, methodical, and devious scheme demands a skillful expos√© by the incongruous, yet highly likeable duo of Dr.Yukama and Detective Kusanagi, the intrepid investigators who are destined to unravel the shocking and mind-boggling conundrum. Imperial University graduates in different fields, Ishigami, Yukama and Kusanagi, seem equally matched; Ishigami, unappreciated mathematical master of a methodical crime committed to protect Yasuko and Misato, and Yukama, preeminent master of rare intuitive observations of human frailties, and Kusanagi, resolute advocate of justice match their unparalleled wits to a stunning unbelievable conclusion. The factual drama predominantly hinges on the intellectual ‚Äúcat and mouse‚Äù chase between Ishigami, ‚ÄúBuddha‚Äù at University and Yukama, affectionately known as ‚ÄúProfessor Galileo‚Äù by the police.

Initially, the translation was a bit stilted, but once engrossed in the book, it was hardly noticeable. In addition to the utterly fascinating and distinctive premise, the cultural milieu depicted an informative contemporary view of Japanese life.",5,,3
review_1114626651,Carol,"Nov 24, 2014","The Devotion of Suspect X is a must-read for anyone who appreciates police procedurals, mysteries, math, Japan, literature . . . I could go on. The Devotion of Suspect X is the third in the Detective Galileo series, but I didn't once have the impression that I lacked background or relationship information gleaned from the initial 2 books. In fact, there were no references to prior cases or mysteries to suggest that earlier books existed. If not for the publishers blurbs on the book, I'd not have guessed they did.

So why is The Devotion of Suspect X an excellent read?
1. The lead detective, Kusanagi, is a normal, standard, by-the-book, thoughtful, straight arrow. What distinguishes this novel from other police procedurals is Kusanagi's friend, Yukawa, a physicist. Yukawa solves the mystery and cares deeply about the outcome. Because ....
2. Ishigami, a high school math teacher whose brilliance and devotion to math are here allocated to assisting his ordinary, likable next door neighbor in covering up a murder, by employing masterful misdirection to focus the police on time-wasting, unimportant questions and issues. His efforts to motivate apathetic high school students won my respect and, at the same time, my pity. Otherwise, he's not an easy character to get to know or to feel anything about, except that Yukawa's concern for him makes the reader care. Nonetheless you respect his genius.
3. The ending is one of the best I've ever read. The mystery is solved 20 pages before. It doesn't matter. There's many a thriller or mystery novelist who get an A+ for plot, but don't have a clue how to write a compelling ending. I read the last several paragraphs a few times over - they were just that good.
4. Japan. The style of this novel is insanely plot-driven and at the same time calm, quiet, methodical, and thoughtful. No screeching tires. No bickering between the detectives. No threatening with guns. In an alternative universe where Lee Child is raised and lives in Japan, this might be the series he'd have written instead of the Jack Reacher books (which I also love, for different reasons, and which are culturally and quintessentially American).

Off to find my next Detective Galileo book....",5,,3
