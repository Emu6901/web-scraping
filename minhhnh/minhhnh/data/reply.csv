review_2322855571,Alfred,"Apr 09, 2018 05:04AM","What language was this originally written in? Perhaps many of those names are spelled in completely different Japanese characters that somehow sound like ""K"" names anglicized.

I don't know Japanese, but seem to hear quite often the common theme of translated best-selling Japanese novels not striking the same connection with English-reading audience. In this case, sounds like it's just the ending that docked it half star...

And, oh, I like bento boxes. Your reviews are like bento boxes."

review_2322855571,carol.,"Apr 09, 2018 07:09AM","Alfred--thank you, as always!

the writer writes in Japanese and his later books have the same translator, someone who majored in Japanese at Harvard, if I'm remembering right. It feels like a solid translation in that I was never conscious of something about the language not quite working, and yet felt a slight sense of cultural difference. I rather liked it and think I'll try another. I thought it worked better than Night Watch (I think that's the name; 'add book' isn't working atm).

There's something that occurs that precipitates the type of ending which I'm slightly ambivalent about. I think that might be an especially cultural-focused element, but the steps that led to it seemed insufficient to me.

Honestly, it's a problem in a few English books I read as well, but I suspect American thriller authors make it as simple as possible. :)"

Rest assured, this is by far the only one that doesn't rely on the thrill of suspense or outrageous murder plots. Rather, it engages you with the subtle, yet vividly distraught fears and dreams of human beings, and how that can turn anyone into someone they're supposedly incapable of being. Brilliant."

That's true, we can't know for certain how many was lost in the translation. Still I am sure that it must be a wonderful reading. The movie was well done, my only complain was that the case lacks the need of solving some scientific challenge like in the TV series."

review_2032216033,Monika,"Aug 20, 2017 12:29PM","I gave it a 4, though I don't disagree with your review. The element I found particularly appealing, perhaps more than the plot itself, was a sort of Japanese lightness (also present in Murakami's books, for example). The very process of reading this book was relaxing for me.
(Btw, I often rely on your reviews in my book choices. Thanks!)"
review_325976623,Dyuti,"Jan 03, 2013 02:39AM","Thanks for stopping by Rahul. Have you noticed this trend with most Japanese books : bad translation?

review_325976623,Rahul Nath,"Jan 03, 2013 02:46AM","Yeah wasn't much of a thriller. I mean the mindgames between Yukawa and Ishigami were great and all, but nothing that kept me on the edge of my seat :P Felt bad for Ishigami though.

Agreed about the translation part. I've got Haruki Murakami's 1Q84 with me now, let's see how that one goes :)"
review_2032216033,Theona,"Aug 20, 2017 02:14PM","I'd have to agree with you on the pacing of the story. it felt to me like something was missing from the translated version or modify for the English version that hurt the story, especially with Ishigami and Yukawa. I think it is a matter of ""lost in translation"" than perhaps the authors actual depiction of these characters."
review_325976623,Dyuti,"Jan 04, 2013 08:02AM","I have not read a single Murakami till date, but many of my GR friends are fans of his. I have my own inhibitions regarding his work. What if it's one of those pseudo-intellectual things which can't be understood by lesser mortals like me. :P

So, unless I can overcome that fear, I won't be able to approach him. Maybe that should be one of my 2013 challenges. Lemme know how you find him."

review_325976623,Sameer,"Jan 04, 2013 08:32AM","@dyuti .. there is nothing pseudo intellectual about murakami. he is a very emotional person and loves imagery. if you love these two aspects you will love him.

Yeah sometimes they are though it does make you wonder wether the inadequacy is in the translation or the quality of the original prose, but either way it is disappointing. If you've read him before and liked it, I guess you'd like this one too. I really had a fun time."

Ioana, this was such a delight!

""86-year-old former scholar who hasn't left his house in 23 years"": LOL!! Can't agree more with you, Julie. We have a good number of translators here who think that they are getting paid for the ability to use huge words in the re-tellings, when they can't even construct a sentence correctly."

I agree, that's not the best way to judge a book. But unfortunately, the cover just raised the expectations.

And independent of any comparison, I didn't like the book. Was it the translation?"
review_925306790,Saoirse,"Jan 26, 2016 02:42AM",You think dragon tattoo is a better book or rather Larsson was a better writer ? You must read Keigo's suspect x or malice or journey under the midnight sun. He is nothing like Larsson and its a good thing. I enjoyed dragon tattoo when I read it the first time but wont read any sequels. Keigo on the other hand makes me beg for more. Oh well to each his or her own !

review_925306790,Manasi,"Nov 26, 2016 11:39PM","Hi, I think you should try read Devotion of Suspect X. That's where he got the title of ""Japanese Steig Larsson"" from. I've read both Salvation of a Saint and Devotion of Suspect X. Yes this isn't his best work, I liked Devotion of suspect X better too. Though it might just be that his style isn't for you. I personally didn't like them tagging him as the Japanese Steig Larsson precisely because I think it's unfair to compare two writers that way even though I haven't read Steig Larsson (he's on the list though) so I guess I'm not qualified to make a judgement in the first place but I guess that's why I liked the book better. Anyway I hope you've found a book you like to keep you company now. :)"

review_925306790,Gitacharya,"Jun 24, 2017 08:12AM","Sujeeth, it is unfair to compare Higashino to Stieg Larsson.

Larsson is just a three book wonder. But Higashino is a master storyteller. It should be proper to say: Larsson is the Higashino of Scandinavian fiction.

May be like you said translation might have made it a bad book for you.

Let me say this: I tried to read this particular book 5 times before, I made my mind to complete it at any cost. I loved the story and the narration. Just that the translation is the biggest problem.

Except for Malice, translation of Higashino oils is mediocre."

review_2495546243,Vivian,"Jan 31, 2019 11:15AM","He usually does not follow the classic pattern of announcing the murderer at the end of the book; instead, the ending is more about wrapping up the emotional fallout, or about an explanation of the crime that includes the history of how the murderer arrived at their crime.

This is what I enjoy about Higashino's work. Of those I've read, this was the least favorite, but still satisfying. I think I prefer the Detective Galilleo work because his character was more flushed out, while this Detective Kaga work seemed to be less so. They both are focused on the psychological and sociological, but Gallileo's character is better integrated into the story."

Hey Fiona,

Thanks for the comment!

Yeah, I can see why you might have felt that the story dragged. The early part of the story was simply filled with self-praising comments from the main character. Also, since it was written in the first person perspective, it only felt fake and a bit aggravating (kind of how one feels when somebody else brags about themselves in front of us for hours and hours).

The kidnapping part was quite short and a lot of time was spent by main character talking to the ""victim"". The banter itself was neither fun nor cute. It was merely used as a device to explain the kidnapping scheme to the reader. Then the sex came out of nowhere (which got explained in the ending and I was quite grateful for that).

Overall, this was nothing like any of the earlier Higashino novels. Not sure how much of these issues were due to translation. But I felt that the story itself was quite weak, regardless of the translation."

Yes a weak story for such a skilled author. I'll still read anything he writes because this is the first disappointment, but I also hope he chooses a different translator in future. (I wondered if this was just me, but other reviewers seem to share my opinion).
Btw, what other authors do you enjoy?"
review_1942005398,Arun,"Apr 04, 2017 06:31AM","Fiona wrote: ""Yes a weak story for such a skilled author. I'll still read anything he writes because this is the first disappointment""
Same here :-) His other works are too damn good for this one work to let me down.

Fiona wrote: ""Btw, what other authors do you enjoy?""
I found Keigo Higashino when I was looking for authors who write mysteries as good as Agatha Christie or Arthur Conan Doyle. Needless to say, I have enjoyed both their works and I found Keigo Higashino to be an awesome mix of Agatha Christie + Conan Doyle. When it comes to crime mystery books, I haven't found any other contemporary novelists as good as Keigo Higashino. I have hopes from Hans Olav Lahlum. I recently read his The Human Flies and found it reasonably good. I might read some of his other works too going forward.

My other interest lies in science fiction where I have recently enjoyed reading Cixin Liu's translated works - The Three-Body Problem, The Dark Forest and Death's End. I hope he continues to write such good science fictions and that it gets translated into English. Other science fiction writes I have enjoyed reading are Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke and Robert A. Heinlein.

Then, there is Aldous Huxley whose works I have quite enjoyed - can be very thought provoking whether you agree with his ideas or not."

Thanks Arun. I'm not a Science Fiction fan but I might give Aldous Huxley a go. I do like a thought provoking work especially if it's a bit controversial. Some authors I enjoy (crime) are Chevy Stevens, early Patricia Cornwell but certainly not anything recent, some of Karin Slaughter's work and a recent one I did enjoy was The Butterfly Garden (disturbing but great). This one is to be made into a movie I believe. I'd love to follow your reading if that's ok?"

It is nowhere near as deep or genius as other reviewers have claimed. The author tries so hard to make us believe the 2 antagonists are that clever, but in the end they fail because of trivial errors they would never make, according to the author, who introduced them earlier as genius tier.

review_1765467430,Ms.pegasus,"Aug 08, 2017 12:10PM","Thanks, Paromjit! I love this author, but he is tricky. You always get something a bit different from what you were expecting. Here, I wasn't really alert to the importance of the neighborhood of the murder until the end of the book. I usually re-read the first couple of chapters before writing a review, and I was struck by how much of a foundation the author lays out in those opening chapters.

As an aside, I was struck by how much closer to the truth of the book the wordpress bloggers I cited got than the reviewers in the regular press. This isn't always the case, but with this book, the author encourages a kind of emotional freedom in the reader that creates great contradictions that need to be sorted out. It certainly took me a few days and some wikipedia articles on Osaka and the oil crisis in Japan to help with that process."

review_2017571767,SaintCarol,"Mar 20, 2022 04:11AM","Agree! First 3/4 of the book was outstanding but after that the focus shifted more to ‘explaining’ and developing our sympathy for the brutal Yuhiko and Ryo. And with that, the book deflated. Also, there was no closure on a couple of characters or story lines from earlier in the book, s.a. Tomohiko who was on to Ryo early, before he disappeared."
review_2017571767,Neer,"Apr 07, 2022 07:49AM","I hated it even before the 75%:). Seriously, this book made me turn even against Higashino because earlier I used to pick up his books without even thinking about it but now haven't read him for long. Can't stand the sympathy-fest for Yuhiko (and she gets away with it too) and Ryo. Thanks for commenting.

เพิ่มนิดนึง ในคอมมูนิตี้ของกลุ่มคนหลากหลายทางเพศเขาไม่แนะนำให้ใช้คำว่า ""เพศที่สาม"" นะครับ เพราะถ้าบอกว่า LGBTQ+ คือเพศที่สาม งั้นเพศที่หนึ่งและเพศที่สองก็ต้องเป็นผู้ชายกับผู้หญิง ซึ่งการจัดความเป็น LGBTQ+ ไปอยู่ในกลุ่มเดียวกับการเป็นชาย/หญิง นี่ยังเป็นความเข้าใจที่ผิดอยู่ครับ

เวลาพูดคำว่า ""เพศ"" เบื้องต้นเราจะแบ่งหลักๆ เป็น 2 ประเภท คือ เพศสภาพ (Gender) กับ เพศวิถี (Sexual Orientation)

เพศสภาพ คือสำนึกทางเพศที่คนๆ นั้นมีต่อตัวเอง เช่น รู้สึกว่าตัวเองเป็นผู้ชาย เป็นผู้หญิง หรือไม่รู้สึกว่าเป็นทั้งผู้ชายและผู้หญิง (Non-Binary)

ในขณะที่เพศวิถีจะบ่งบอกว่าคนๆ นั้นมีความรู้สึกดึงดูดทางกายหรือทางใจกับเพศไหนบ้าง เช่น ถ้ามีเพศสภาพเป็นผู้หญิง แล้วรู้สึกดึงดูดกับผู้หญิงด้วยกัน ก็คือคนๆ นั้นเป็นผู้หญิงที่มีเพศวิถีเป็นเลสเบี้ยน หรือถ้าเป็นผู้หญิงแล้วรู้สึกดึงดูดกับผู้ชาย ก็คือคนๆ นั้นเป็นผู้หญิงที่มีเพศวิถีเป็นเสตรท เป็นต้น

เพราะงั้นความเป็นผู้ชาย ผู้หญิง กับการเป็น LGBTQ+ จึงไม่ได้จัดอยู่ในกลุ่มเดียวกัน แต่ประเทศเราไม่ค่อยได้สอนเรื่องนี้ หลายคนเลยยังเข้าใจว่า LGBTQ+ เป็นเพศสภาพแบบเดียวกับการเป็นชายหญิง และมองว่าการเป็นเกย์หรือเป็นเลสเบี้ยนนี่คือเพศใหม่ต่อจากชายหญิงไปเลย ซึ่งเป็นความเข้าใจที่ผิดครับ

เพื่อลดความเข้าใจผิดตรงนี้ เขาเลยแนะนำให้ใช้คำว่า ""LGBTQ+"" หรือไม่ก็ ""กลุ่มคนหลากหลายทางเพศ"" แทนครับ (เพศทางเลือกก็ไม่แนะนำให้ใช้ เพราะเขามองว่าคนที่เป็น LGBTQ+ ไม่ได้ ""เลือก"" จะเป็น LGBTQ+ แต่มันเป็นเรื่องของรสนิยมที่อาจจะติดตัวมาตั้งแต่เกิดเสียมากกว่า)"
review_3641151228,Thanawat,"Nov 12, 2020 04:00PM",ชอบทั้งสองอย่างเลย ทั้งความ “ซับซ้อน” และ “ไปไกล” ของ LGBTQ ในญี่ปุ่น และทั้งเรื่องการใช้อเมริกันฟุตบอลเปรียบเทียบบทบาทและ character ของตัวละคร

review_3991241711,ไม้ไต่คู้,"May 11, 2021 04:58AM","เห็นเพจไดฟุกุแชร์รีวิวมาในเฟส ลองอ่านอีกที เลยเอะใจว่าหรือที่ตอนแรกคุณณัฐพิมว่าเพศที่สาม คุณณัฐจะหมายถึงคนที่เพศสภาพไม่ตรงเพศกำเนิด? ถ้าใช่ก็ใช้คำว่า ""คนข้ามเพศ"" (Transgender) ไปเลยก็ได้ครับ

คือจริงๆ ใช้คำว่า LBGTQ+ แบบที่เขียนไปก็ได้ เพราะตัว T ใน LGBTQ+ ก็คือ Transgender นั่นแหละ แต่ถ้าเนื้อหาส่วนไหนเจาะจงพูดถึงคนข้ามเพศ ใช้คำว่าคนข้ามเพศไปเลยก็จะได้ความหมายที่เฉพาะเจาะจงขึ้น อันนี้แล้วแต่จุดประสงค์ว่าเนื้อหาส่วนนั้นกำลังพูดถึง LGBTQ+ ทั้งกลุ่มหรือเฉพาะ Transgender ครับ

มาแชร์อีกที เพราะเรื่องนี้ผมอ่านนานจนจำได้แค่ว่าตัวละครหลักเป็นคนข้ามเพศ แต่จำไม่ได้ว่าเป็นคนข้ามเพศที่เป็นเกย์, เลสเบี้ยน หรือไบเซกชวล ด้วยรึเปล่า"

It's so amazing the way you expressed your feeling about the book. I'm a big admirer of this author but sometimes I feel so frustrated because we do not have many Keigo's works published in Vietnam and I can find english edition nowhere online. What a pity!

ขออภัยตอบช้าค่ะ ทำไมเพิ่งเห็นคำถามไม่รู้ >,<
ส่วนตัวเรามองว่า สองเรื่องนี้คล้ายๆ กันค่ะ
ตายวันแต่งนี่คือมีคนตาย
แล้วผู้เขียนเล่าเรื่องผ่านผู้ต้องสงสัย 3 คน
โดยส่งไม้ต่อเล่าไปข้างหน้าเรื่อยๆ ไม่มีย้อนเล่าซ้ำ
ส่วนปกชมพูม่วง ใครฆ่าเธอ
นางเอกตายในห้องตัวเอง
หลังจากโทรไปบอกพี่ชายว่าอยากตาย
แต่ผู้เขียนใช้วิธีเล่าคนละแบบ
เรื่องนี้ เล่าผ่านมุมมองพี่ชายที่เป็นตำรวจ (ต่างจังหวัด) ค่ะ
พี่ชายพยายามปกปิดข้อมูลคุณคางะ เจ้าของคดี
เพราะอยากสืบคดีนี้เอง
โดยรวม เหมือนตรงตอนจบนี่แหละค่ะ
ที่ผู้เขียนไม่ยอมเฉลยตัวฆาตกรเหมือนกัน 555"
