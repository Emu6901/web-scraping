review_2322855571,Alfred,"Apr 09, 2018 05:04AM","What language was this originally written in? Perhaps many of those names are spelled in completely different Japanese characters that somehow sound like ""K"" names anglicized.

I don't know Japanese, but seem to hear quite often the common theme of translated best-selling Japanese novels not striking the same connection with English-reading audience. In this case, sounds like it's just the ending that docked it half star...

And, oh, I like bento boxes. Your reviews are like bento boxes."

review_2322855571,carol.,"Apr 09, 2018 07:09AM","Alfred--thank you, as always!

the writer writes in Japanese and his later books have the same translator, someone who majored in Japanese at Harvard, if I'm remembering right. It feels like a solid translation in that I was never conscious of something about the language not quite working, and yet felt a slight sense of cultural difference. I rather liked it and think I'll try another. I thought it worked better than Night Watch (I think that's the name; 'add book' isn't working atm).

There's something that occurs that precipitates the type of ending which I'm slightly ambivalent about. I think that might be an especially cultural-focused element, but the steps that led to it seemed insufficient to me.

Honestly, it's a problem in a few English books I read as well, but I suspect American thriller authors make it as simple as possible. :)"

That's true, we can't know for certain how many was lost in the translation. Still I am sure that it must be a wonderful reading. The movie was well done, my only complain was that the case lacks the need of solving some scientific challenge like in the TV series."

review_2032216033,Monika,"Aug 20, 2017 12:29PM","I gave it a 4, though I don't disagree with your review. The element I found particularly appealing, perhaps more than the plot itself, was a sort of Japanese lightness (also present in Murakami's books, for example). The very process of reading this book was relaxing for me.

review_2032216033,Theona,"Aug 20, 2017 02:14PM","I'd have to agree with you on the pacing of the story. it felt to me like something was missing from the translated version or modify for the English version that hurt the story, especially with Ishigami and Yukawa. I think it is a matter of ""lost in translation"" than perhaps the authors actual depiction of these characters."
review_325976623,Rahul Nath,"Jan 03, 2013 01:56AM","Same case with me. The Japanese write some great thrillers, I've read some amazing manga thrillers like Monster, Death Note and 20th Century Boys. Couldn't enjoy this novel as much as I wanted to due to the translation."

review_325976623,Dyuti,"Jan 03, 2013 02:39AM","Thanks for stopping by Rahul. Have you noticed this trend with most Japanese books : bad translation? This was my first, so cant decide whether that's the usual norm. Besides this book scores higher on the emotional quotient than the thrill factor... the extent one could go to because of love."
review_325976623,Rahul Nath,"Jan 03, 2013 02:46AM","Yeah wasn't much of a thriller. I mean the mindgames between Yukawa and Ishigami were great and all, but nothing that kept me on the edge of my seat :P Felt bad for Ishigami though.

Agreed about the translation part. I've got Haruki Murakami's 1Q84 with me now, let's see how that one goes :)"
review_325976623,Dyuti,"Jan 04, 2013 08:02AM","I have not read a single Murakami till date, but many of my GR friends are fans of his. I have my own inhibitions regarding his work. What if it's one of those pseudo-intellectual things which can't be understood by lesser mortals like me. :P

So, unless I can overcome that fear, I won't be able to approach him. Maybe that should be one of my 2013 challenges. Lemme know how you find him."
review_325976623,Sameer,"Jan 04, 2013 08:32AM","@dyuti .. there is nothing pseudo intellectual about murakami. he is a very emotional person and loves imagery. if you love these two aspects you will love him. And anyway whats psuedointellectual to one person might be completely relelvant to som eother. why not give it a try. if you like being carried away on a magic carpet to some place very surreal yet rooted in the real world, check out his kafka on the shore."

Yeah sometimes they are though it does make you wonder wether the inadequacy is in the translation or the quality of the original prose, but either way it is disappointing. If you've read him before and liked it, I guess you'd like this one too. I really had a fun time."

Ioana, this was such a delight! What I've heard is that Japanese mysteries tend to focus on ordinary, good people becoming murderers under the right circumstances, so there's not a lot of gore or suspense. In fact, the murderer is often revealed at the beginning. I think you'll enjoy this one for sure!"

""86-year-old former scholar who hasn't left his house in 23 years"": LOL!! Can't agree more with you, Julie. We have a good number of translators here who think that they are getting paid for the ability to use huge words in the re-tellings, when they can't even construct a sentence correctly."

I personally didn't like them tagging him as the Japanese Steig Larsson precisely because I think it's unfair to compare two writers that way even though I haven't read Steig Larsson (he's on the list though) so I guess I'm not qualified to make a judgement in the first place but I guess that's why I liked the book better.

Larsson is just a three book wonder. But Higashino is a master storyteller. It should be proper to say: Larsson is the Higashino of Scandinavian fiction.

May be like you said translation might have made it a bad book for you.

Let me say this: I tried to read this particular book 5 times before, I made my mind to complete it at any cost. I loved the story and the narration. Just that the translation is the biggest problem.

Except for Malice, translation of Higashino oils is mediocre."

review_2495546243,Aditya,"Jan 31, 2019 10:26AM",Don't you feel like you are missing out on the subtleties with a translated version? Or do you not mind getting a slightly reduced reading experience as long as you it is still going to be a great read? I never got around to the Millennium trilogy in spite of all its plaudits for the same. And great analysis as always.

review_2495546243,Vivian,"Jan 31, 2019 11:15AM","He usually does not follow the classic pattern of announcing the murderer at the end of the book; instead, the ending is more about wrapping up the emotional fallout, or about an explanation of the crime that includes the history of how the murderer arrived at their crime.

This is what I enjoy about Higashino's work. Of those I've read, this was the least favorite, but still satisfying. I think I prefer the Detective Galilleo work because his character was more flushed out, while this Detective Kaga work seemed to be less so. They both are focused on the psychological and sociological, but Gallileo's character is better integrated into the story."

Hey Fiona,

Thanks for the comment!

Yeah, I can see why you might have felt that the story dragged. The early part of the story was simply filled with self-praising comments from the main character. Also, since it was written in the first person perspective, it only felt fake and a bit aggravating (kind of how one feels when somebody else brags about themselves in front of us for hours and hours).

The kidnapping part was quite short and a lot of time was spent by main character talking to the ""victim"". The banter itself was neither fun nor cute. It was merely used as a device to explain the kidnapping scheme to the reader. Then the sex came out of nowhere (which got explained in the ending and I was quite grateful for that).

Overall, this was nothing like any of the earlier Higashino novels. Not sure how much of these issues were due to translation. But I felt that the story itself was quite weak, regardless of the translation."

Yes a weak story for such a skilled author. I'll still read anything he writes because this is the first disappointment, but I also hope he chooses a different translator in future. (I wondered if this was just me, but other reviewers seem to share my opinion).
Btw, what other authors do you enjoy?"

Same here :-) His other works are too damn good for this one work to let me down.

Fiona wrote: ""Btw, what other authors do you enjoy?""
I found Keigo Higashino when I was looking for authors who write mysteries as good as Agatha Christie or Arthur Conan Doyle. Needless to say, I have enjoyed both their works and I found Keigo Higashino to be an awesome mix of Agatha Christie + Conan Doyle. When it comes to crime mystery books, I haven't found any other contemporary novelists as good as Keigo Higashino. I have hopes from Hans Olav Lahlum. I recently read his The Human Flies and found it reasonably good. I might read some of his other works too going forward.

My other interest lies in science fiction where I have recently enjoyed reading Cixin Liu's translated works - The Three-Body Problem, The Dark Forest and Death's End. I hope he continues to write such good science fictions and that it gets translated into English. Other science fiction writes I have enjoyed reading are Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke and Robert A. Heinlein.

Then, there is Aldous Huxley whose works I have quite enjoyed - can be very thought provoking whether you agree with his ideas or not."

Thanks Arun. I'm not a Science Fiction fan but I might give Aldous Huxley a go. I do like a thought provoking work especially if it's a bit controversial. Some authors I enjoy (crime) are Chevy Stevens, early Patricia Cornwell but certainly not anything recent, some of Karin Slaughter's work and a recent one I did enjoy was The Butterfly Garden (disturbing but great).

After few seconds, I wondered if she committed it or not and why has the author not mentioned about it. :( In his book ""Devotion of Suspect X"", he has clearly mentioned the END. But in this, the end can be 80% guessed (Suicide), still, a 20% of me doesn't wanna believe that Yukiho died. :( :D
PS: Just finished it today, I haven't come out from the effect yet), I loved it totally. :) Wonderful ride. :)"

review_1560923784,bookfox,"May 24, 2020 05:31AM","Wish I had seen this review and read the spoilers before buying and finishing this book myself. I agree with your wholeheartedly. It is nowhere near as deep or genius as other reviewers have claimed. The author tries so hard to make us believe the 2 antagonists are that clever, but in the end they fail because of trivial errors they would never make, according to the author, who introduced them earlier as genius tier.

Here, I wasn't really alert to the importance of the neighborhood of the murder until the end of the book. I usually re-read the first couple of chapters before writing a review, and I was struck by how much of a foundation the author lays out in those opening chapters.

review_1765467430,Ms.pegasus,"Aug 09, 2017 06:10AM","Thanks, Jaline. As an aside, I was struck by how much closer to the truth of the book the wordpress bloggers I cited got than the reviewers in the regular press. This isn't always the case, but with this book, the author encourages a kind of emotional freedom in the reader that creates great contradictions that need to be sorted out. It certainly took me a few days and some wikipedia articles on Osaka and the oil crisis in Japan to help with that process."

review_2017571767,SaintCarol,"Mar 20, 2022 04:11AM","Agree! First 3/4 of the book was outstanding but after that the focus shifted more to ‚Äòexplaining‚Äô and developing our sympathy for the brutal Yuhiko and Ryo. And with that, the book deflated. Also, there was no closure on a couple of characters or story lines from earlier in the book, s.a. Tomohiko who was on to Ryo early, before he disappeared."
review_2017571767,Neer,"Apr 07, 2022 07:49AM","I hated it even before the 75%:). Seriously, this book made me turn even against Higashino because earlier I used to pick up his books without even thinking about it but now haven't read him for long. Can't stand the sympathy-fest for Yuhiko (and she gets away with it too) and Ryo. Thanks for commenting.

I read the two ""Professor Galileo"" books first and thoroughly enjoyed them, then discovered that this was the book that won the Japan Mystery Writers Award and asked my public library to order it. I just finished it and the premise of the two personalities and the father/husband reactthat Higashino explores makes for a riveting story. Now if I could just find the movie."

review_1485938457,Smitha,"Apr 30, 2016 09:51PM","The Devotion of Suspect X is good, so also Salvation of a Saint - both by the above author.
The first Japanese book I remember liking is The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle by Murakami. But be prepared for lots of things that are not ordinary - the thing called as magical realism.
Murakami is my favorite Jap author followed by Higashino."

review_2495379095,carol.,"Aug 19, 2018 07:07PM","Shoot! I think so, but there is a subtlety to the interactions of Yukawa and the Inspector that wouldn't mean much.

The Devotion of Suspect X is the first one in the series translated into English (according to GR, it's book #3), and Salvation of a Saint is the other (book #5). There's not significant changes in the character lives, or any sense of following their intimate lives, except something happens in Suspect X that impacts the relationship between the two men.

They aren't really ""consecutive"" any more than Christie's Hercule Poirot books were, I think. Stuff happened with Captain Hastings and Poirot, but it wasn't earth-shattering."

I read that one first.
It is like any detective series which does not need continuity to understand, though continuity helps a bit."

I had no idea!! He seems so literary, especially compared to the second translator."
review_4608833441,Beth,"Apr 08, 2022 01:26PM","He's particularly well known for re-translating Final Fantasy Tactics, whose previous version was infamous for hilariously quotable lines like ""Tough. Don't blame us. Blame yourself or God."" Funnily enough, the first game site headline I found about Smith's translation grumped about its being ""pretentious."" It's more of an attempt at Shakespeare lite.



This is getting somewhat off-topic for the comments section of a mystery novel review... üòÖ"
review_4608833441,carol.,"Apr 08, 2022 01:38PM","It continues my fascination with the idea of translation, though :)"
review_4608833441,Carol,"Apr 08, 2022 02:17PM","Ugh. How disappointing. They‚Äôre being translated out of order so I‚Äôd have to check original pub dates to take a POV on whether it‚Äôs a Higashino inconsistency or Higashino talent-fade issue. I pre-ordered but haven‚Äôt read this one yet, but your points are always well-made, so ‚Ä¶. This is just sad."
review_4608833441,Carol,"Apr 08, 2022 02:19PM","In the translation issue, I‚Äôve noticed that he doesn‚Äôt consistently work with any one translator. I almost think his US publisher is hiring on a one-off basis and the winner doesn‚Äôt have any contact with Higashino at all. But I‚Äôm not blaming them for his product. He owns that."
review_4608833441,carol.,"Apr 08, 2022 03:45PM","I will be extremely interested in what you think, Carol. Some of his other mysteries were slow, to be certain, but this pacing was just... odd. I was strangely reminded American thriller writers whose quality deteriorated after their careers skyrocketed."

Hi Becky! Glad to know you find my rating helpful, I personally don't think much of Higashino (too much hyper) but he produced good stuff from time to time."

Good news: it isn't about ghost. But there is a super super spooky abandoned house."
